          <h1>Croatia</h1>
        </div>
        <p>
          Croatia is a parliamentary democracy where the prime minister and cabinet hold executive power, and the president has largely ceremonial duties. 
          Migration policy is led by the Ministry of the Interior and the Ministry of Foreign and European Affairs, guided by national legislation and EU frameworks.
          Ukrainian and other refugee flows illustrate both the country’s frontline responsibilities and the challenges of balancing enforcement with protection.

      <h2>Europe at a glance</h2>
      <p>
        The conservative ruling party emphasizes EU alignment while prioritizing border security, and right-wing coalition partners push stricter anti-immigration measures, creating a mix of enforcement and integration policies. Interior Minister Davor Božinović focuses on deterrence, border protection, and implementing the EU Pact on Migration and Asylum. 
        Croatia’s experience with the 1990s wars shapes public and political attitudes toward migration, resulting in policies that combine strong external control, cooperation with neighbouring states, and targeted local integration initiatives.</p>

        <h2>Political climate</h2>
        <p>
          Croatia is a parliamentary representative democracy in which executive power rests with a prime minister and cabinet accountable to parliament, while a directly elected president performs largely ceremonial and some foreign-policy functions (European Commission, 2025). Migration governance is therefore shaped by national ministries (notably the Ministry of the Interior and the Ministry of Foreign and European Affairs), legislative acts such as the Aliens Act, and EU mechanisms that increasingly channel responsibilities for external border management to frontline states.
          The party landscape matters for migration policy. The conservative Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ), led by Andrej Plenković, has traditionally combined pro-European integration with a security-minded approach to borders; the Social Democratic Party (SDP) is more centrist-left on social integration but also pragmatic on enforcement; while newer right-wing forces such as the Homeland Movement (Domovinski pokret) push a harder anti-immigration stance and have pulled parts of the governing coalition toward tougher rhetoric and policies.
