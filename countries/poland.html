        <h1>Poland</h1>
      </div>
      <p>
        Poland’s migration profile has shifted fast. In the early 2010s, the country had around 100,000
        foreign residents, but by 2024 this rose to an estimated 2.5 million. Since Russia’s invasion of
        Ukraine (2022), Poland has taken in more than one million Ukrainian refugees. Since 2018,
        Poland has a positive migration balance, yet migration remains politically sensitive and the
        foreign-born share is still only about 2–3% of the population.

        <h2>Europe at a glance</h2>
        <p>
          Poland sits on the EU’s eastern flank and is a frontline state for two major dynamics:
          (1) the Belarus border crisis (2021–2023), where migrants were pushed towards Poland as
          political pressure, and (2) the arrival of Ukrainians after 2022 under temporary protection and
          work-based channels. The country combines high labour-related inflows with strict control of
          irregular routes and strong border securitisation.

        <h2>Political climate</h2>
        <p class="section-political">
          Migration in Poland is shaped by a mix of labour needs, security framing, and party politics.
          The Law and Justice party (PiS) governed from 2015–2023 and used strong anti-immigration
          messaging, including rejecting EU refugee relocation during the 2015 crisis. At the same time,
          immigration reached record levels due to labour shortages, especially from Ukraine and Belarus.
          After the 2023 election, a centrist coalition led by Donald Tusk took power. While more aligned
          with the EU, the government still maintains a tough stance on migration to avoid losing ground
          to PiS, keeping strict border controls and emphasising “control and security”.

        <h2>Migration statistics</h2>
        <p class="section-migration">
          Key figures from the profile:
          • Foreign residents: ~100,000 (early 2010s) → ~2.5 million (estimated 2024).
          • Ukrainian refugees hosted since 2022: more than 1 million; around 1.5 million lived in Poland by 2023.
          • First residence permits: Poland issued more first residence permits to non-EU nationals than any other EU Member State between 2017–2022; in 2021 it issued about 967,000 first residence permits.
          • Asylum applications: relatively low — around 7,700 in 2023 (mostly from Belarus, Ukraine, and Russia).

        <h2>Current policies</h2>
        <p class="section-policies">
          Poland follows a “selective” approach: labour migration that supports the economy is facilitated,
          while irregular arrivals are strongly discouraged. On labour migration, Poland is tightening and
          professionalising procedures after a 2023 visa scandal. The Law on Employment of Foreigners
          (2023) strengthens the legal framework, digitises work permits, and aims to increase transparency.
          On asylum and borders, policy is strict and became harder during the Belarus border crisis:
          pushbacks, a steel border barrier, and expanded security measures. In late 2024, the government
          proposed allowing a temporary suspension of the right to claim asylum during heavy migration
          pressure (e.g., up to 60 days, extendable with parliamentary approval), with exceptions for
          vulnerable cases.

        <h2>Application possibilities</h2>
        <p class="section-application">
          Poland’s reception and integration system is relatively young because the country historically
          was not a major migration destination. The arrival of many Ukrainians forced rapid scaling:
          schools had to accommodate large numbers of new pupils, and workplaces faced language and
          cultural barriers. The profile highlights that Ukrainian refugees brought measurable economic
          benefits (estimated GDP increase around 2.7%) without raising unemployment or lowering wages,
          which supported policy moves to ease pathways from temporary protection to work-based stays.
          Still, experts warn that a strong security-first migration strategy may limit the long-term
          effectiveness of integration policies.
