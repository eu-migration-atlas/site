          <p class="about-lead">
            The EU Migration Atlas is a student project developed within the minor
            <strong>Cross-Border Migration, Governance and Security</strong> at
            NHL Stenden University of Applied Sciences.

          <h2>Project context</h2>
          <p>
            The project is based on fictional briefing materials inspired by the
            European Commission’s Directorate-General for Migration and Home Affairs
            (DG HOME). These materials provide a conceptual foundation for analysing
            trends, policy developments and governance structures related to
            migration within the European Union.
          </p>
          <p>
            This website functions as a prototype platform designed to present
            accessible, comparative insights into migration policies across EU
            Member States. The structure, visual design and technical implementation
            are developed by students for academic purposes only.
          </p>
