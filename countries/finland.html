          <h1>Finland</h1>
        </div>
        <p>
          Finland has been a member of the EU since January 1, 1995. Its migration policy is grounded in government objectives, EU legislation, and international agreements including the European Convention on Human Rights, the UN Convention against Torture, the Convention on the Rights of the Child, and the Geneva Refugee Convention. The policy encourages immigration to meet demographic needs linked to an aging population, while supporting labour migration through a functioning permit system that accounts for employers’ and business needs. Finland also contributes to EU migration and asylum policymaking and, amid the world’s most severe refugee crisis since WWII, is obligated under international agreements to accept asylum seekers in need of protection.

      <h2>Europe at a glance</h2>
      <p>Finland is a parliamentary democracy where coalition governments are the norm, and the 2023 elections shifted politics toward a more right-leaning coalition. Migration has become a prominent issue as net migration has been positive since 1990, with record arrivals in 2022 driven by inflows from Ukraine, Russia, the Philippines, and Türkiye. This evolving context places Finland at the center of EU debates on asylum, border security, and labour migration.</p>

        <h2>Political climate</h2>
        <p>
          The National Coalition Party and the Finns Party lead a right-leaning coalition under Prime Minister Petteri Orpo, and the Finns Party’s restrictive stance on immigration shapes policy direction. The government has pledged tighter immigration and citizenship rules and aims to reduce the number of people applying for international protection. The broader political agenda includes responding to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, strengthening defense spending, and reinforcing support for Ukraine while managing border security and migration pressures.

        <h2>Migration statistics</h2>
        <p>
          OECD data show that Finland received around 35,000 long-term immigrants in 2024, a 19% decrease from 2023. Family migration dominated these flows (55%), followed by labour migration (22%), EU free movement (16%), and humanitarian migration (6%), indicating that demographic and labour-market needs drive most long-term arrivals. In 2023, Ukraine was the largest source of newcomers following the Temporary Protection Directive, while Russia saw the largest decline; other key origin countries included the Philippines, Sri Lanka, India, and Bangladesh.

        <h2>Current policies</h2>
        <p>
          Finland’s migration framework is anchored by the Aliens Act (301/2004, amended through 389/2023), which regulates residence permits, entry grounds, family reunification, and border security. Asylum governance is supported by the Act on Reception Points and Centers for Asylum Seekers (1465/1991) and the Act on the reception of persons seeking international protection and recognition of victims of trafficking, which set procedures and safeguards for protection applicants and trafficking victims. Integration policy is set out in the Integration Act (681/2023, updated), while citizenship is governed by the Nationality Act (359/2003). Anti-discrimination protections are provided by the Non-Discrimination Act (1325/2014), ensuring equal treatment across services, employment, and public life.

        <h2>Application possibilities</h2>
        <p>
          Pathways to stay in Finland include labour migration permits that are designed to function efficiently for employers, family reunification routes regulated under the Aliens Act, and international protection procedures supported by reception centers. Integration measures under the Integration Act provide language training, employment support, education pathways, and cooperation between municipalities and service providers. Long-term residents may pursue citizenship under the Nationality Act by meeting residence, language, and integrity requirements, enabling full participation in society.
