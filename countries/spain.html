        </div>
        <p>
          Spain sits at the crossroads of Europe, North Africa, and Latin America, making migration a defining element of its recent social and economic transformation. Once a country of emigration, Spain became a major destination from the late 1990s onward as labour demand surged in construction, agriculture, tourism, and domestic services. This shift created a large foreign-born population with strong ties to Latin America and North Africa, while also exposing tensions in labour markets, integration policy, and regional autonomy.

      <h2>Europe at a glance</h2>
      <p>Spain has experienced one of the fastest migration-driven demographic shifts in Europe. Since EU accession in 1986, and especially after the late-1990s boom, Spain emerged as a primary destination for migrants from Latin America, North Africa, and Eastern Europe. The scale and speed of inflows reshaped settlement patterns, labour markets, and public institutions, while the economic downturns of 2008 and the pandemic years highlighted vulnerabilities in sectors reliant on foreign labour.</p>
      <p>Today, Spain combines a comparatively open approach to integration with a labour market that remains segmented. Migration is central to Spain’s economic model, yet political fragmentation and regional dynamics shape how national reforms are negotiated and implemented across the country.</p>

        <h2>Political climate</h2>
        <p>
          Spain’s migration policy is shaped by political fragmentation at the national level and strong regional identities. The 2019 and 2023 general elections consolidated a multiparty system in which coalition-building is essential, and regional parties hold significant leverage in government formation. This dynamic affects migration policy debates, which often intersect with labour market needs, border management, and regional autonomy.

          <br>
          Caption/Note: Between 2019 and 2023, the right bloc made the largest gains, rising from 141 to 170 seats (+29), while the left bloc slightly declined, reinforcing Spain’s political fragmentation and increasing the significance of regional parties in government formation.

          <br>
          Caption/Note: Spain’s migration landscape is driven primarily by inflows from Latin America and North Africa, strong dependence on foreign labour, and a labour market where foreign-born workers participate and work at higher rates than native-born Spaniards—yet still face higher unemployment.

          Caption/Note: The chart shows that most population growth in Spain between 2015 and 2023 comes from foreigners and dual-nationality residents, while the Spanish-born population declines across nearly all working-age groups. Source: CaixaBank Research, based on INE (LFS).

          <br>
          Description: Sorted by year and nationality, this video illustrates the shifts in demographic for immigrant groups in Spain.
          <br><br>
          Video 2 — Immigrants in Spain are an essential part of their labor force.
          <br>
          Description: Spain is highly reliant in very critical sectors on foreign workers and labour to stimulate economic growth. But the experts in this video warn that it doesn’t translate into wealth to the public.
          <br><br>
          Video 3 — Immigrants integrate and form essential part of the Spanish experience.
          <br>
          Description: This video highlights how immigrants make up for a lot of sectors most of the workforce and often integrate very well within Spanish society. Employment is a good pathway towards permanent residence.

        <h2>Current policies</h2>
        <p>
          Spain’s immigration system blends legal pathways with regularization mechanisms, reflecting a pragmatic approach to labour demand and integration. A defining feature is the arraigo regularization framework, which allows long-term residents without status to obtain residence permits through social, family, employment, or training-based ties. This approach assumes irregularity is temporary and emphasizes labour market inclusion as the main route to stability.
          <br><br>
          A major reform, the new Regulation on Foreigners that took effect in May 2025, aimed to streamline procedures, align national rules with EU standards, and strengthen integration through work, training, and family pathways. Spain also maintains flexible access to employment for students and asylum seekers, and collaborates with partner countries such as Morocco on circular migration and seasonal labour agreements.
          <br><br>
          While Spain offers comparatively inclusive rights and a path to citizenship for many foreign-born residents, the system remains uneven. Labour market segmentation persists, with foreign-born workers concentrated in critical but lower-paid sectors, and regional governments often play a decisive role in implementation.
