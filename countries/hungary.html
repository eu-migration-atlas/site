        <p>
          Since the 2015 migration crisis, the European Union has operated under shared guidelines and legal norms, while each member state remains responsible for translating those standards into national legislation and implementation. Hungary illustrates this dynamic clearly: even as a transit country rather than a primary destination, successive governments have placed extraordinary weight on national security and the preservation of identity. That framing has strongly shaped policy choices, operational practices, and the institutions that manage migration, asylum, and residence decisions in Hungary, making the country a salient case for understanding how EU-level obligations intersect with highly nationalized policy narratives.

      <h2>Europe at a glance</h2>
      <p>Hungary sits at the heart of EU migration debates because its government has consistently interpreted migration through the lens of security, sovereignty, and cultural continuity, while EU institutions and courts have repeatedly pushed back on perceived breaches of asylum standards. This tension has made Hungary a focal point in wider European discussions about responsibility-sharing, border control, and the balance between EU law and national policy discretion. The country’s role as a transit corridor in 2015–2016, combined with its leadership’s strong stance against long-term settlement, positions Hungary as a defining case in the contemporary European migration landscape.</p>

        <h2>Political climate</h2>
        <p>
          Migration policy in Hungary is driven by a concentrated set of political actors and institutions. Prime Minister Viktor Orbán and the governing Fidesz party set the overarching agenda, with Interior Minister Sándor Pintér and Foreign Affairs and Trade Minister Péter Szijjártó shaping enforcement, institutional design, and international messaging. Since 2015, a consistent anti-immigration narrative has proven politically effective and has anchored domestic policy choices (Farkas, 2024). Orbán has articulated a demographic vision explicitly rejecting migration as a long-term solution: “By 2035, Hungary must be demographically self-sustaining. There can be no question of population decline being compensated by migration. The Western experience is that if there are more guests than hosts, then home is no longer home. This is a risk that must not be taken.”
          <br><br>
          European institutions have played a sustained countervailing role. The European Commission and the Court of Justice of the EU have repeatedly challenged Hungarian measures and imposed rulings and fines for breaches of EU asylum law, including a 2020-related case where Hungary failed to ensure applicants could remain pending final appeal decisions and did not properly address removal of illegally staying third-country nationals (Reuters, 2024). Civil society and human-rights organizations, notably the Hungarian Helsinki Committee, also shape the policy conversation by documenting pushbacks, legal abuses, and restrictive administrative practices.
          <br><br>
          Public opinion is heavily influenced by these actors, with government framing casting migration as an existential threat to national identity and security. This rhetoric has become an electoral and policy tool across the political spectrum, contributing to broadly negative public attitudes toward migration despite variation among parties (Meral &amp; Kumar, 2025).

          Fig. 1 illustrates the top 10 nationalities of immigrants entering Latvia in 2023, intended to highlight shifts from earlier data (noted as 2022–13), though the comparison year appears inconsistent and may require verification since Latvia’s published statistics for the same category list 2023 figures.

          Fig. 2 provides a Hungary-specific snapshot: a donut chart showing the distribution of 66,862 new long-term residence permits issued in 2024 (permits longer than 12 months), excluding EU citizens. Together, these visuals contextualize Hungary’s migration profile with a regional comparison while emphasizing the composition of long-term residence outcomes in 2024.

        <h2>Current policies</h2>
        <p>
          Hungary’s legal framework for migration is defined by several core instruments: the Migration Strategy 2014–2020; the Law on Foreigners (Act II of 2007); the Asylum Law (Act LXXX of 2007); the Citizenship Law (Act LV of 1993); the Anti-Discrimination Law (Act CXXV of 2003); and the Guest Worker Law (Act L of 2023). From this body of law, several policy patterns emerge.
          <br><br>
          First, Hungary operates a dual migration system that combines restrictive protection with selective admission. The 2007 Foreigners Act and 2007 Asylum Act, alongside subsequent reforms, tightly regulate humanitarian admission and long-term settlement, while the 2023 Guest Worker Law is comparatively open to temporary labor migration that is economically useful but offers no pathways to integration or citizenship.
          <br><br>
          Second, protection-focused rights have narrowed over time as security controls have expanded. Although the Asylum Act originally aligned closely with EU standards, amendments from 2015–2020 raised barriers to accessing asylum. Similarly, the Foreigners Act broadened state discretion to refuse entry, detain, and remove migrants with limited procedural safeguards.
          <br><br>
          Third, integration and anti-discrimination measures exist on paper but are weak in implementation. The Migration Strategy recognized integration needs, yet Hungary reduced access to protection and did not build robust integration mechanisms. The Anti-Discrimination Act provides baseline protections, but practical measures for equal access to services or anti-xenophobia policy are underdeveloped.
          <br><br>
          Fourth, citizenship policy remains exclusionary and identity-driven. The Citizenship Act follows an ethnic-national model, providing preferential access for ethnic Hungarians abroad, while imposing high barriers to naturalization, strict residency requirements, and demanding integration criteria. In combination with restrictive asylum rules, this signals that migration is not framed as a long-term demographic renewal strategy.
          <br><br>
          Fifth, there is an increasing emphasis on temporary or rotational labor rather than settlement. The 2023 Guest Worker Law explicitly prevents workers from settling, reuniting with family, or accessing long-term rights.
          <br><br>
          Finally, the legal framework supports a political narrative of control, homogeneity, and “managed migration,” aligning with the long-term stance of the Fidesz government.
