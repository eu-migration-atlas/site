      <h2>Europe at a glance</h2>
      <p>
        Cyprus’ migration governance is formed by its presidential political system, fragmented party landscape, and the long-standing division of the island. 
        The President and key institutions particularly the Ministry of Interior, the Immigration Department, and the Deputy Minister of Migration and International Protection play central roles in policy development and implementation. 
        Political parties range from rights-based approaches on the left to stricter enforcement positions among centre-right and nationalist groups, reflecting rising public concern over irregular migration. 
        The unresolved Cyprus conflict and tensions with Türkiye make border control, especially along the Green Line, a politically sensitive issue. 
        Migration legislation is anchored in the Aliens and Immigration Law and Refugees Law, complemented by EU obligations under CEAS and upcoming reforms linked to the EU Pact on Migration and Asylum. 
        Despite EU support, Cyprus faces significant challenges, including reception capacity limits, asylum backlogs, and monitoring concerns. 
        Overall, its policy approach balances enforcement, humanitarian responsibilities, and EU compliance under complex geopolitical conditions.

        <h2>Political climate</h2>
        <p>
          The political landscape in Cyprus is fragmented, and parties differ substantially in their approaches to migration. The centrist Democratic Party (DIKO) generally supports balanced policies that combine border security with integration efforts. 
          The leftist Progressive Party of Working People (AKEL) emphasizes social inclusion and rights-based integration for asylum seekers and refugees. The right-leaning Democratic Rally (DISY) promotes a pragmatic approach that prioritizes border control while remaining aligned with EU frameworks. 
          Emerging parties and nationalist factions often adopt more restrictive positions, reflecting broader public concern over irregular migration, particularly at the northern Green Line and the southern maritime border. 
          These differences create a policy environment that oscillates between enforcement-oriented and integration-oriented approaches, depending on coalition composition and electoral cycles.

        <h2>Migration statistics</h2>
        <p>
          In November 2022, Austria reported the highest number of first-time asylum applicants per million population at 2,111, followed by Cyprus with over 1,300 applicants. 
          Other countries with notable numbers included Germany, Croatia, Estonia, Greece, and Luxembourg, all reporting between 300 and 450 applicants per million. 
          Conversely, several nations such as Romania, Latvia, Poland, Portugal, Lithuania, Slovakia, Czechia, and Hungary registered very low numbers of asylum seekers. 
          Looking specifically at Cyprus, asylum applications fluctuated significantly between 2009 and 2019. After an initial peak of 3,192 applications in 2009 and 2,882 in 2010, numbers declined to a low of 1,346 in 2013. 
          Subsequently, applications saw a substantial increase, reaching a peak of 7,713 in 2018 before slightly decreasing to 6,554 in 2019. More recent data comparing monthly trends for 2023 and 2024 (January to September) shows differing patterns. 
          In 2023, applications started around 600 in January and peaked at nearly 1,200 in March, with numbers generally remaining high throughout the period. In contrast, 2024 began with higher numbers than 2023 in January, reaching a similar peak to 2023 in March. 
          However, 2024 experienced a sharp decline in applications from April to May, dropping from over 1,100 to approximately 200, and remained at significantly lower levels compared to 2023 for the subsequent months.

        <h2>Current policies</h2>
        <p>
          Cyprus’ migration and asylum policy is shaped by a combination of national legislation and EU-level obligations. 
          The primary legal instruments include the Aliens and Immigration Law, the Refugees Law, and complementary administrative regulations overseen by the Ministry of Interior and the Immigration Department. 
          These frameworks regulate entry, stay, work permits, and asylum procedures, providing formal mechanisms for reception, integration, and protection. 
          Implementation is operationalized through the Immigration Department, the Asylum Service, police authorities, and municipal administrations responsible for accommodation and integration measures.
          EU law strongly influences national policy. Cyprus implements the acquis communautaire in areas including asylum procedure standards, reception conditions, and border management. 
          Preparations for the EU Pact on Migration and Asylum, along with reforms to the CEAS, guide legislative and administrative planning. 
          For instance, Cyprus aligns asylum procedure timing, admissibility assessments, and procedural safeguards with EU benchmarks, while Frontex and the EUAA provide technical support for capacity-building and surveillance. 
          These frameworks are particularly relevant at the Green Line and maritime borders, which require harmonization with EU external border standards.

        <h2>Application possibilities</h2>
        <p>
          Institutional responsibilities are distributed across multiple actors. 
          The Ministry of Interior leads policy formulation and operational oversight, while the Deputy Minister of Migration and International Protection, Dr. Ioannides, coordinates cross-sectoral implementation. 
          The Immigration Department and Asylum Service handle procedural administration, the police enforce border control, and municipal authorities engage in reception and integration initiatives. 
          Parliamentary oversight and judicial review ensure legal compliance and accountability. Practical effects are mixed. 
          EU-aligned reforms have improved procedural clarity, registration practices, and integration measures, but irregular migration pressures remain high, particularly from regional conflict zones. 
          Public opinion reflects concern over perceived migration-related security risks, placing pressure on policymakers to prioritize enforcement. 
          Simultaneously, Cyprus must meet EU obligations to provide protection and facilitate integration, creating a dual-track policy dynamic between restrictive control measures and rights-based administrative implementation.
