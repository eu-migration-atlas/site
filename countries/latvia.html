        <h2>Political climate</h2>
       
        </p>
        When it comes to migration in Latvia, there are several key factors and actors that need to be
taken into account.
      </p>
The main ministry that deals with laws and regulations as well as their implementation is the
Ministry of Interior. Other important government-related institutions are the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs, Diplomatic missions abroad, and the Ministry of Welfare (European Commission, 2021).
For deepening the understanding of the context, it is important to note that during the Soviet
era, Latvia experienced significant migration flows, as they were primarily driven by centralised
labour allocation and relatively high living standards. This led to a demographic shift, as
Latvians became only 52% of the population by 1989. Following the USSR’s collapse in the 90s,
a wave of emigration occurred, with many Russian speakers moving, as well as returning
Latvian refugees. Post-independence and EU accession saw a huge influx of Latvians moving
to Western countries. The country’s economic growth and declining population highlighted a
need for skilled foreign labour (Migration Partnership Facility, 2025).
      </p>
With recent economic improvements, Latvia became more attractive to foreign workers from
Ukraine and Belarus. However, despite these trends, immigration rates remain lower than the
OECD average and below those of neighbouring countries. The Russian invasion of Ukraine in
2022 led to a further substantial inflow of Ukrainians. These immigration dynamics have sparked
public debates on security, economic and demographic issues. With the current conditions,
labour migration could be seen as a solution but public opinion is divided: some advocate for
embracing it, others want focus to be put on retaining and attracting back Latvian youth and
expats (Migration Partnership Facility, 2025).

        <h2>Current policies</h2>
        <p>
          Migration is highly regulated and rule-bound: there are specific laws and regulations for
each stage of migration (visas, residence permits, language exams, finance, EU-related,
long-term residence, asylum, document fees, consular procedures etc), which shows a
detailed and tightly managed system.
        </p>
- Strong emphasis on language and integration obligations: several laws directly regulate
Latvian language proficiency and permanent residence and long-term EU status requires
that.
      </p>
      
- The Meaning of “non-citizens” of the former USSR: the Former USSR Citizens Law
deals with Latvia’s legacy specific category of ‘non-citizens’ - the people who were
permanent residents during the Soviet period but never obtained Latvian citizenship.
      </p>
- Laws are aligned with EU standards but remain nationally specific: strong alignment
persists through long-term residence regulations, procedures for EU citizens, and visa
rules; strict national control persists through language testing, financial means
requirements, and additional assessment lists (CM 554).
      </p>
        
- Security-conscious and risk-screening oriented: regulations like CM 554 (extra
assessment for certain nationalities) and detailed visa procedures show risk-based
migration control as Latvia actively screens migrants based on origin and security
considerations.
      </p>
        
- Clear distinction between migration and asylum: The Asylum Law (2015) stands
separate from the main Immigration Law. This indicates a dual-track system that has
one regime for migration related to work, studies, family reunification, and long-term
residents, and another for humanitarian protection.
      </p>
        
- Financial self-sufficiency is a core requirement: economic independence in preventing
welfare burdens is crucial for residence permit approval.
-Strong administrative infrastructure: there is a regulation for every procedure, as this
reflects a centralised and formalized migration administration.
      </p>
    
-Labour migration policy is restrictive, despite demographic need: as Latvia is one of the
fastest ageing and shrinking populations in the EU, the tight control of migration remains
(especially in labour migration). According to OECD and ICMPD research, Latvia has not
stategicallt leveraged migration to address shortages in construction, engineering,
manufacturing, ICT, and healthcare (Migration Partnership Facility, 2025)
