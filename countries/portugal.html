      <h2>Europe at a glance</h2>
      <p>In 2026, Portugal celebrates its 40th anniversary of joining the European Union, a milestone that underscores its transformation into a modern, resilient, and highly integrated member state.

        <h2>Political climate</h2>
        <p>
       In 2025, the agency for integration, migration and asylum in Portugal, is completely
overwhelmed. Indeed, they are still processing more than 900,000 immigration cases. And
almost the half submitted their applications through the manifestation of interest, which
have already been reviewed. The issue is, many applicants are still waiting for their
residency cards, with no specific timeline for delivery. Until the new government takes
office, delays are expected to continue.
        </p>
Historically, the Social Party has been the dominant party. However, since May 28 2025,
CHEGA (meaning Enough! the populist far right party founded in 2019) has gained massive popularity and has become the second-largest political force in Portugal. This rise of far
right political parties can be explained by several factors. These factors being, media
visibility first.
      </p>
Indeed, through both social media and television Ventura (the leader of Chega) built a
strong personalized presence. Every of his actions was updated on the news, feeding
media coverage to its extremes.
Of course another factor of this rise is also the European trend, while taking the example of
France, Italy… It quickly leads up to a mass effect

        <h2>Migration statistics</h2>
        <p>
          According to the OECD International Migration Outlook 2024, Portugal has experienced a significant shift in its migration profile, becoming a major destination within the EU. In 2023, permanent-type migration to Portugal reached a record high, driven by a surge in labor and family reunification. The report highlights that foreign-born individuals now make up approximately 11% to 12% of Portugal's total population, a figure that has grown rapidly over the last decade. Furthermore, the number of foreign students in Portuguese schools has increased by 160% over the last five years, reaching approximately 140,000 in the 2023–2024 academic year (representing 13.9% of the total student body). On the economic front, the OECD notes that migrant workers have been crucial in addressing labor shortages, with the employment rate for immigrants standing at a robust 70% to 75%, nearly on par with the native-born population. Despite these gains, the report points out that roughly 25-30% of new students do not speak Portuguese at home, underscoring the ongoing challenge of linguistic and social integration within the education and labor sectors.

        <h2>Current policies</h2>
        <p>
          The New Foreigner's Law, which is supposed to be put in action in October 2025, is a new policy that focuses on the control of migrants coming in Portugal. This law is characterized by two major changes aiming at being more selective and putting more enforcement in borders control.
          <p>
            First, the law introduces a clear preference for highly qualified worker. Now, the Job Seeking Visa is only applying for this limited group. Applicants must secure employment within 120 days of arrival, or else they will be required to leave the country and may only reapply after one year. Plus, a ban on entry is granted to foreign worker without a valid work permit.
         <p>
           Alongside stricter work visa conditions, the new law implemented the end of the "expression of interest" system. It was a mechanism that previously allowed undocumented migrants to legalize their status based on employments and social security contributions. Now, migrants have to secure a proper visa from a Portuguese consulate abroad before their arrival. This leads to the control and reducing of irregular migration but also closing the door on essential workers needed in sectors like hospitality and construction.
         <p>
           Furthermore, family reunification policies are becoming tighter. Indeed, applicants must now complete two years of legal residence in Portugal before they can apply for family reunification. Plus, from now on, they must meet requirements for both adequate housing and financial stability. Exceptions are made for minor children already living in the country. The new law goes even further. If the applicants is granted family reunification, their family member must attend Portuguese language and civic values training and minors are required to be enrolled in compulsory education.
         <p>
           Finally, the road to citizenship is becoming longer. Under current law, to apply for Portuguese nationality, you have to be a resident for at least five years. But from now on, it is ten years. However, it is seven years for EU member states and members of the Community of Portuguese Language Countries (Brazil, Angola, Cabo Verde...).
