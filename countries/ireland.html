          Ireland, popularly known as the "Emerald Isle," is an island nation in the North Atlantic celebrated for its lush landscapes, rich literary history, and vibrant folk traditions. It is politically divided into the Republic of Ireland, a sovereign state covering five-sixths of the island, and Northern Ireland, which is part of the United Kingdom.

      <h2>Europe at a glance</h2>
      <p>Ireland has been a member of the European Union since 1973. It is the only country in the
European Union that is not a part of the Schengen Area (European Union, n.d.-a). 
      </p>
     This is a
result of the United Kingdom’s decision to sustain its national borders and Ireland preferring to
keep the Common Travel Area (CTA) with the UK (BBC News, 2016): a bilateral free movement
arrangement between the United Kingdom, its Crown Dependencies and Ireland, which was
agreed upon before both the UK and Ireland joined the EU. It provides citizens from these
territories with freedom of movement and the freedom to work, study and vote in all territories
involved, similar to the rights of EU citizens in Schengen countries (Cabinet Office & Home
Office, 2022.</p>

        <h2>Political climate</h2>
        <p>
          The political system of Ireland is a parliamentary republic. The head of government is Prime
Minister (Taoiseach in Irish) Micheál Martin, leader of the progressive republican party, Fianna
Fáil (McClafferty, 2025). The party values democratic stability, unity, promoting and stimulating
innovation and employment, as well as a stable democracy, and a stable country in terms of
education, housing and public services (Lawless, n.d.). Similar to other European countries, the
debate on immigration has risen in Ireland. Taoiseach Micheál Martin spoke out last month,
saying that economic migrants seeking asylum in Ireland with the knowledge that they will be
rejected should stop attempting to enter the country, as the level of asylum seekers in Ireland
has seen a significant increase post-COVID. The majority of such asylum seekers receive
rejection of their application, and their return is taking too long, making it a social issue.
Additionally, he acknowledged that this is a Europe-wide issue (Clarke & Coyne, 2025). The
debate on migration has also been heated up in Ireland because of anti-immigration riots, for
instance, in Citywest. Citywest houses a large group of asylum seekers, which has been
answered with protests from local residents. The riots followed an incident of sexual assault by
a male foreigner on a 10-year-old Irish girl in State care (Pollak, 2025).
As Ireland shares a border with Northern Ireland and is a part of the CTA, border crossings from
and to Northern Ireland (part of the UK) have also sparked tensions. The Irish Minister of Justice
claimed that the majority (87%) of individuals seeking international protection in Ireland arrived
in the country by crossing the shared border. He therefore also supports stricter asylum rules,
but believes this should not involve sending them back to the UK, as they face similar problems
(Gataveckaite, 2025).

        <h2>Migration statistics</h2>
        <p>
          According to the Government of Ireland’s website, 15.5% of the Irish population is non-Irish. Of
this non-Irish population, many are from other EU countries (50%) or the UK (13%), and around
one-third are from outside the EU or UK. The migration saldo is approximately 79,300 in 2024,
where 86,800 immigrants were non-EU, non-UK, and non-Irish. Ireland received roughly
150,000 immigrants from April 2023 to April 2024. This number is almost equal to the 12 months
preceding: from April 2022 to April 2023, Ireland received 140,000 immigrants. Since 2022,
Ireland has experienced a surge in migration. A large part of these high immigration numbers is
attributed to the number of Ukrainians who fled due to Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine
and took residence in Ireland under the Temporary Protection Directive (CSO, 2023).
The majority of Ireland’s applications in 2023 concerned visas (62%), followed by temporary
protection, citizenship applications, and international protection applications. This last number is
quite small, 13,000 applications, representing roughly 5% of all applications Ireland received.
As of September 2024, 32,000 asylum seekers are living in international protection
accommodations in Ireland. One in five workers in Ireland is non-Irish, reflecting the value of
migrant labourers for the Irish economy. Over the past decade, the share of non-Irish workers in
Ireland has grown remarkably across different sectors (Department of the Taoiseach, 2024b)

        <h2>Current policies</h2>
        <p>
          Martin’s comments on the large number of rejected asylum seekers remaining in the country
received backlash from the leader of the Labour Party, Ivana Bacik, who claimed that this
situation is a result of the government’s failure in the asylum system, opening debate on how to
handle Ireland’s migration policies and what kind of system to use (Cunningham, 2025). This
inflamed debate on immigration, sparking accusations between politicians, highlights how
immigration has only recently become a significant topic in Ireland. The current system in
Ireland has different assets. First of all, as an EU member state, the country complies with the
freedom of movement for EU, EEA, and UK nationals. Under the EU’s Temporary Protection,
Ukrainians are allowed to reside and work in Ireland until 2027 (Department of Justice, Home
Affairs and Migration, 19 November 2025). Most third-country nationals receive study, work, or
residence visas, which vary per immigrant category, and must be renewed periodically.
Additionally, workers are required to obtain a work permit before arrival. Tourists may apply for
a Short Stay Tourist visa (Department of the Taoiseach, 2024a). When individuals seek
international protection, they undergo a formal application procedure processed by the
International Protection Office (IPO). Once the application is accepted by the IPO the asylum
seeker will receive a Temporary Residence Certificate (TRC), allowing them to stay in Ireland
with limitations while their application is processed. Additionally, Ireland has a list of safe
countries. When an applicant is a national of this country, their waiting time for their application
is reduced to accelerate the process of their application (Department of Justice, Home Affairs
and Migration, 12 April 2025).

        <h2>Application possibilities</h2>
        <p>
          Migrating to Ireland involves a structured system of residency permissions, known as "Stamps," which are currently undergoing a digital and financial modernization to better align with the 2026 labor market. The most common pathway for non-EU/EEA nationals is through the Employment Permit system, where the Critical Skills Employment Permit offers a fast track to permanent residency (Stamp 4) for highly skilled professionals, while the General Employment Permit serves roles experiencing broader labor shortages; notably, as of March 2026, minimum salary thresholds for these permits have risen to €40,904 and €36,605 respectively. Students also have significant opportunities through the Stamp 2 visa, which allows for part-time work during studies and provides a "Stay Back" option (Stamp 1G) for up to 24 months after graduation to seek full-time employment. With the recent centralization of registrations and the implementation of the EU Migration and Asylum Pact in 2026, the application process is becoming increasingly digital and rules-based, making it essential for migrants to meet specific financial and qualification criteria to secure long-term residency or eventual citizenship after five years.
