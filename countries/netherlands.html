        </div>
        <p>
          The Netherlands is a highly developed, densely populated constitutional monarchy in Western Europe. As of early 2026, the country is navigating a significant political transition while maintaining its status as a critical global logistics hub and a pillar of the European Union.

      <h2>Europe at a glance</h2>
      <p>In 2026, the Netherlands continues to act as a fiscal "anchor" and a logistics powerhouse within the European Union. Despite recent domestic political shifts, the country remains a key "frugal" member, consistently advocating for strict adherence to the Stability and Growth Pact while maintaining its role as the EU's fifth-largest economy.</p>

        <h2>Political climate</h2>
        <p>
          Migration policy has become a subject of national interest in the Netherlands,
especially under Schoof’s Cabinet, between 2023 and 2025. On 1 December 2023, as a
result of the parliamentary elections, PVV became the largest party in the House of
Representatives with 37 seats, followed by GroenLinks/PvdA (25; +8 seats), the VVD
(24; -10 seats), and NSC (from 0 to 20 seats). In this round of elections, the loss of all
government parties, including D66 (9; -15 seats) and CDA (5; -10 seats), stood out the
most (De Nederlandse Grondwet, 2023).
        </p>
The new cabinet, under Minister Schoof, comprised PVV, VVD, NSC, and BBB, and took
a significantly different approach compared to the last coalition in how to tackle the
problem of migration.

        <h2>Migration statistics</h2>
        <p>
          According to the OECD International Migration Outlook 2024 and supplementary 2024 data, the Netherlands is experiencing a cooling period following the post-pandemic and Ukrainian refugee surges. In 2024, approximately 316,000 immigrants arrived in the country, a decrease of 19,000 compared to the previous year. The most significant shift occurred among "knowledge migrants" (highly skilled workers) from outside the EU, whose numbers plummeted to 16,000 a 26% drop from 2023 and a staggering 39% decrease from the 2022 peak. Despite this slowdown, the Netherlands remains a major destination for family-related migration, which accounted for roughly 73,000 arrivals in 2023 (nearly 25% of all migrants). Labor market integration remains a strong point, with the employment rate for the foreign-born population reaching approximately 73, 75%, though the OECD notes that these workers are still disproportionately concentrated in lower-paying sectors compared to native-born citizens.

        <h2>Current policies</h2>
        <p>
          Under Minister Faber, a handful of restrictive measures were proposed, including a
legislative “asylum package” for a stricter asylum regime (Government of the
Netherlands, 2024).
        </p>
The Asylum Emergency Measures Act includes the abolition of permanent residence
permits, limiting the period of validity of asylum permits to three years, broadening the
order declaring a person an undesirable foreign national, limiting travel to the
Netherlands in connection with family reunification to nuclear families, as well as
measures to make asylum procedures more efficient (Rijksoverheid, 2025a).
      </p>
Additionally, the Asylum Emergency Act incorporates a new Article 108a to the Aliens
Act 2000. The new amendment aims to reduce illegal entry or residence in the
Netherlands by making it a criminal offence for an adult foreign national to remain in the
Netherlands while knowing or suspecting that their stay is not lawful (Government of
the Netherlands, 2025). Other legislative proposals by Minister Faber include the
introduction of a Dual Status system, meant to differentiate between refugees and
people granted protection under different circumstances (Eerste Kamer der Staten-
Generaal, 2025).

        <h2>Application possibilities</h2>
        <p>
          In 2026, application and integration pathways in the Netherlands are defined by a "work-first" digitalized system and a significant role for local municipalities. Non-EU/EEA nationals primarily enter through the Highly Skilled Migrant scheme, which as of January 1, 2026, requires a minimum monthly gross income of €5,942 for those over 30 and €4,357 for those under 30. Applications are handled via the IND (Immigration and Naturalisation Service), often requiring a recognized employer-sponsor. Integration is governed by the Civic Integration Act 2021, which mandates that newcomers achieve B1 level Dutch proficiency within three years, with municipalities providing personalized "learning routes" that combine language training with work experience. For permanent residency or naturalization, applicants must pass the civic integration exam (currently at A2 level, though B1 is the target for newer cohorts), reflecting the government's dual focus on economic contribution and social self-reliance.
