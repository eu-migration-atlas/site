        <h2>Political climate</h2>
        <p>
          Italy’s political environment is currently shaped by a right-wing coalition led by Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, whose party ‘Fratelli d’Italia’ has become a dominant force in national politics (European Parliament, 2024). This coalition places strong emphasis on border control, national security, and a stricter approach to migration, which directly influences the country’s policy choices. Recent political statements show that the government presents its migration approach as a “model to follow” for other European countries, highlighting a commitment to tougher external border control and off-shore asylum processing (Politico Europe, 2025). 
Migration therefore plays a central role in Italian politics, partly because the country is a key entry point on the Central Mediterranean route and faces continuous pressure on its reception system. 
        <p>
Recent European election results confirm this broader political direction. Fratelli d’Italia received the largest share (28.75%), followed by the centre-left Democratic Party ‘Partito Democratico’ (24.11%) and the Five Star Movement ‘Movimento Cinque Stelle’ (9.98%). The strong representation of right-wing groups such as the European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR) and Patriots for Europe (PfE) in Italy’s EU delegation shows that Italy’s political climate is firmly oriented toward conservative and nationalist positions. These dynamics shape how the country approaches migration debates both domestically and at EU level (European Parliament, 2024).  
        <p>
Italy’s migration policy focuses mainly on limiting irregular arrivals and speeding up return procedures. The government has introduced stricter border measures and works more closely with non-EU countries to manage movements across the Central Mediterranean. Part of this approach includes identifying ‘safe countries’ more quickly and handling some asylum procedures outside Italian territory. These steps are meant to reduce pressure on Italy’s reception system and to keep the process more efficient (EMN, 2024). At the same time, OECD data show that Italy also depends on legal labour migration to address workforce shortages in sectors such as health care, agriculture and construction, adding another layer to the country's broader migration debate (OECD, 2025). 
        <p>
Given this political context, Italy continues to experience high pressure within its reception system. Italy receives a large number of sea arrivals, especially on Lampedusa and along the Sicilian coast. Eurostat data show that Italy continues to record one of the highest numbers of asylum applications in the EU (Eurostat, 2025). The country uses a system of hotspots and reception centres, but these can become overcrowded during periods of high arrivals. The government has also introduced faster procedures for people coming from countries it considers safe, although courts continue to check whether these rules follow EU standards. Organisations such as UNHCR and IOM note that Italy still faces challenges in keeping reception conditions consistent across regions and highlight that vulnerable groups such as unaccompanied minors and victims of exploitation require special attention (IOM, 2025; UNHCR, 2025). 
        <p>
This structural pressure has pushed Italy to explore alternative policy approaches within the EU asylum framework, although these efforts often create tension with EU regulations. Recent court cases illustrate this: Italy’s attempts to designate certain countries as ‘safe’ for rapid return were challenged by the Court of Justice of the European Union, limiting the government’s ability to reject asylum claims. At the same time, Italy promotes new ideas such as processing asylum claims in Albania, which has received mixed reactions from other Member States. Although the first transfers have taken place, several Italian courts have ruled against key elements of the protocol, meaning the system is not yet fully operational in legal terms. The government presents these steps as practical solutions to reduce pressure on the reception system, but they remain controversial among courts and human rights groups. Upcoming changes in EU migration policy are expected to influence Italy’s approach in the coming year (Politico Europe, 2025).
