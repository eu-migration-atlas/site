        <p>
          Spain shares land borders with Portugal to the west, France and Andorra to the north and northeast, and Morocco to the south across the Strait of Gibraltar. Gibraltar also shares a border with Spain. It has been a member of the European Union since January 1 1986.

      <h2>Europe at a glance</h2>
      <p>Spain has gone through a rapid demographic transformation over the past three decades, evolving from a nation historically defined by emigration to one of the European Union's primary destinations for international migrants. </p>
      <p>A quickly growing construction sector, coupled with strong demand in agriculture, tourism, and domestic services resulted in Spain becoming the second-largest recipient of immigrants among OECD countries between 2002 and 2014.</p>

        <h2>Political climate</h2>
        <p>
          The political environment in which Spain's migration policy is formulated is one of significant fragmentation and polarization. The November 2023 general election resulted in a deeply divided parliament, with no single party or traditional coalition able to secure a governing majority. 
          This outcome forced Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez of the center-left PSOE to form a fragile coalition with the left-wing Sumar party, relying on the support of various regional parties to pass legislation.

        <h2>Migration statistics</h2>
        <p>
          As of the most recent data, the foreign-born population in Spain is estimated to be between 11% and 16% of the total population of approximately 47-48 million, with the largest communities originating from Morocco, Romania, Colombia, and Venezuela. This economic dependence on foreign labor has created a clear, yet often contradictory, immigration policy framework. 
          To attract highly skilled professionals, Spain operates a dual regime, offering both a national residence and work permit under Law 14/2013 for entrepreneurs, investors, and highly qualified professionals, and the EU Blue Card. The national scheme has proven to be much more accessible and popular. In 2021 alone, over 30,000 visas were issued under Law 14/2013.

        <h2>Current policies</h2>
        <p>
          Spain's migration policy is best understood as a complex ecosystem of formal and informal pathways, reflecting the tension between its economic need for labor and the political difficulty of managing immigration openly. The system can be analysed through three primary channels: the regularization of undocumented migrants ('arraigo'), seasonal labor migration, and the attraction of highly skilled workers.
          The most significant, yet unofficial, pathway to legal status for third-country nationals is the 'arraigo' regularization process. 
          This system allows undocumented immigrants who have been living and working in Spain for a certain period to apply for a residence permit. A major reform on May 20, 2025, aimed to address some of these criticisms by streamlining the application process, reducing bureaucratic hurdles, and introducing a new 'arraigo socio-educativo' category. 
          This reform is seen as an effort to align Spain's practices more closely with EU standards and to create a more humane and predictable pathway to legal status..

        <h2>Application possibilities</h2>
        <p>
          For sectors with high seasonal demand, such as agriculture and tourism, Spain relies on the GECCO (General Employment of Foreign Workers in Spain) program. This system allows employers to apply for work permits for non-EU nationals to fill specific jobs for a defined period. 
          A significant reform in 2022 overhauled this program, introducing a new 4-year visa that permits nine months of work annually. 
          This was a major shift from the previous system of short-term, often one-year permits. The new visa provides greater stability for both workers and employers and offers a clear path to a two-year residence permit after four years of compliant work..
