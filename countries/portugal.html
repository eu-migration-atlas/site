          Portugal is a republic in southwestern Europe, bordered by Spain. It has been a member of the European Union since 1986.

        <h2>Political climate</h2>
        <p>
          Historically, Portugal was a dictatorship until 1975, when it transitioned to a parliamentary democracy. A multi-party electoral system was established and in 1976 the country adopted a constitution.
          The central governmnet holds executive auhtority and shapes policies in areas like healthcare, education, and taxation.
        <p>
The country has both a president and prime minister. The President, Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, serves as the head of state and holds significant power, while the prime minister, Luís Montenegro, leader of the Social Democratic Party, manages the daily operations of the government.  
        <p>
Italy’s migration policy focuses mainly on limiting irregular arrivals and speeding up return procedures. The government has introduced stricter border measures and works more closely with non-EU countries to manage movements across the Central Mediterranean. Part of this approach includes identifying ‘safe countries’ more quickly and handling some asylum procedures outside Italian territory. These steps are meant to reduce pressure on Italy’s reception system and to keep the process more efficient (EMN, 2024). At the same time, OECD data show that Italy also depends on legal labour migration to address workforce shortages in sectors such as health care, agriculture and construction, adding another layer to the country's broader migration debate (OECD, 2025). 
        <p>
Given this political context, Italy continues to experience high pressure within its reception system. Italy receives a large number of sea arrivals, especially on Lampedusa and along the Sicilian coast. Eurostat data show that Italy continues to record one of the highest numbers of asylum applications in the EU (Eurostat, 2025). The country uses a system of hotspots and reception centres, but these can become overcrowded during periods of high arrivals. The government has also introduced faster procedures for people coming from countries it considers safe, although courts continue to check whether these rules follow EU standards. Organisations such as UNHCR and IOM note that Italy still faces challenges in keeping reception conditions consistent across regions and highlight that vulnerable groups such as unaccompanied minors and victims of exploitation require special attention (IOM, 2025; UNHCR, 2025). 
        <p>
This structural pressure has pushed Italy to explore alternative policy approaches within the EU asylum framework, although these efforts often create tension with EU regulations. Recent court cases illustrate this: Italy’s attempts to designate certain countries as ‘safe’ for rapid return were challenged by the Court of Justice of the European Union, limiting the government’s ability to reject asylum claims. At the same time, Italy promotes new ideas such as processing asylum claims in Albania, which has received mixed reactions from other Member States. Although the first transfers have taken place, several Italian courts have ruled against key elements of the protocol, meaning the system is not yet fully operational in legal terms. The government presents these steps as practical solutions to reduce pressure on the reception system, but they remain controversial among courts and human rights groups. Upcoming changes in EU migration policy are expected to influence Italy’s approach in the coming year (Politico Europe, 2025).

        <h2>Current policies</h2>
        <p>
          The New Foreigner's Law, which is supposed to be put in action in October 2025, is a new policy that focuses on the control of migrants coming in Portugal. This law is characterized by two major changes aiming at being more selective and putting more enforcement in borders control.
          <p>
            First, the law introduces a clear preference for highly qualified worker. Now, the Job Seeking Visa is only applying for this limited group. Applicants must secure employment within 120 days of arrival, or else they will be required to leave the country and may only reapply after one year. Plus, a ban on entry is granted to foreign worker without a valid work permit.
         <p>
           Alongside stricter work visa conditions, the new law implemented the end of the "expression of interest" system. It was a mechanism that previously allowed undocumented migrants to legalize their status based on employments and social security contributions. Now, migrants have to secure a proper visa from a Portuguese consulate abroad before their arrival. This leads to the control and reducing of irregular migration but also closing the door on essential workers needed in sectors like hospitality and construction.
         <p>
           Furthermore, family reunification policies are becoming tighter. Indeed, applicants must now complete two years of legal residence in Portugal before they can apply for family reunification. Plus, from now on, they must meet requirements for both adequate housing and financial stability. Exceptions are made for minor children already living in the country. The new law goes even further. If the applicants is granted family reunification, their family member must attend Portuguese language and civic values training and minors are required to be enrolled in compulsory education.
         <p>
           Finally, the road to cizitenship is becoming longer. Under current law, to apply for Portuguese nationality, you have to be resident for at least five years. But from now on, it is ten years. However, it is seven years for EU member states and members of the Community of Portuguese Language Countries (Brazil, Angola, Cabo Verde...).
