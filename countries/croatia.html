          <h1>Croatia</h1>
        </div>
        <p>
          Croatia is a parliamentary democracy where the prime minister and cabinet hold executive power, and the president has largely ceremonial duties. 
          Migration policy is led by the Ministry of the Interior and the Ministry of Foreign and European Affairs, guided by national legislation and EU frameworks.
          Ukrainian and other refugee flows illustrate both the country’s frontline responsibilities and the challenges of balancing enforcement with protection.

      <h2>Europe at a glance</h2>
      <p>
        The conservative ruling party emphasizes EU alignment while prioritizing border security, and right-wing coalition partners push stricter anti-immigration measures, creating a mix of enforcement and integration policies. Interior Minister Davor Božinović focuses on deterrence, border protection, and implementing the EU Pact on Migration and Asylum. 
        Croatia’s experience with the 1990s wars shapes public and political attitudes toward migration, resulting in policies that combine strong external control, cooperation with neighbouring states, and targeted local integration initiatives.</p>

        <h2>Political climate</h2>
        <p>
          Croatia is a parliamentary representative democracy in which executive power rests with a prime minister and cabinet accountable to parliament, while a directly elected president performs largely ceremonial and some foreign-policy functions (European Commission, 2025). Migration governance is therefore shaped by national ministries (notably the Ministry of the Interior and the Ministry of Foreign and European Affairs), legislative acts such as the Aliens Act, and EU mechanisms that increasingly channel responsibilities for external border management to frontline states.
          The party landscape matters for migration policy. The conservative Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ), led by Andrej Plenković, has traditionally combined pro-European integration with a security-minded approach to borders; the Social Democratic Party (SDP) is more centrist-left on social integration but also pragmatic on enforcement; while newer right-wing forces such as the Homeland Movement (Domovinski pokret) push a harder anti-immigration stance and have pulled parts of the governing coalition toward tougher rhetoric and policies.

        <h2>Migration statistics</h2>
        <p>
          Croatia experienced a significant shift in migration patterns between 2015 and 2024. While emigration remained relatively high, fluctuating between approximately 30,000 and 46,000 annually, immigration saw a dramatic increase. 
          Immigrant numbers steadily rose from around 12,000 in 2015 to nearly 40,000 by 2019, dipped slightly in 2020, then surged to almost 60,000 in 2022 and exceeded 69,000 by 2023 and 2024. This trend indicates a strong positive net migration in recent years, with a notable peak in immigrant arrivals in 2023 at 69,726, up from 8,207 in 2018. 
          Work and residence permits are predominantly issued in the Construction sector, accounting for approximately 14,800 permits, followed by Tourism with about 12,000 permits, Manufacturing with 8,000, Agriculture with 5,000, and IT with 3,000. In terms of nationality, citizens from Bosnia and Herzegovina received the highest number of residence and work permits, totaling around 40,000. Serbia and Nepal followed, with approximately 26,000 and 25,000 permits respectively, while India, North Macedonia, and the Philippines also represented significant recipient nationalities. 
          Additionally, data from 2023 on illegal border crossings reveals Afghanistan as the leading country of origin, accounting for 36% of crossings, followed by Turkey at 22%, Morocco at 10%, and Pakistan at 9%, with Iraq and Syria also contributing notable percentages.

        <h2>Current policies</h2>
        <p>
          Croatia’s migration policy is governed by a mix of national legislation and EU given instruments, where the Ministry of the Interior plays the central operational role and the Croatian Parliament passes the legal framework that gives effect to EU rules (European Commission, 2025). 
          Key domestic instruments address entry, stay and removal of third-country nationals (for example long-term residence rules and the Foreigners Act) and sit alongside asylum procedures for international protection; operational practice is implemented by police authorities and administrative bodies responsible for residence permits and integration measures.

        <h2>Application possibilities</h2>
        <p>
          On asylum and protection, monitoring by AIDA and national reporting show a twofold dynamic: formal alignment with EU procedures and persistent implementation gaps. 
          AIDA’s 2024 update documents issues in asylum procedure guarantees, reception conditions and access to effective remedies, despite reforms (AIDA, 2025). The Croatian Law Centre’s National Asylum Report 2024 records a significant decline in irregular entries and applicants in 2024, but flags procedural and capacity issues that affect access to protection and transparency of practice (Croatian Law Centre, 2025). 
          Thus, while legislation has been adjusted, watchdogs note continued concerns about how rules operate at the border and in reception centres.
