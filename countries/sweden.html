      <p>In 2026, Sweden marks 31 years of European Union membership, acting as a "Nordic stabilizer" that combines fiscal discipline with a strong push for a competitive green transition. Within the EU framework, Sweden is a net contributor to the budget.</p>

        <h2>Political climate</h2>
        <p>
          In the past, Sweden has been seen as a county with an openness towards immigrants
and leniency towards asylum seekers. In 2014 and 2015, a large number of people fled
to Europe from the war-torn Middle East, specifically Syria, and many of them came to
Sweden. The Swedish government urged the Swedish population to ‘open their hearts’
to immigrants and did e:ort to facilitate integration. Furthermore, refugees also
perceived Sweden as a desired destination, as the country is seen as liberal and
accepting with a stable economy, lauded for their environmentally sustainable
practices and high quality of life. 
        </p>
        The current government, elected in October 2022, is more conservative than the
previous one. It is led by Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson and consists of the Moderate
Party, the Christian Democrats and the Liberals. The presiding stance of the Swedish
government is that the nation needs a respite from high numbers of asylum seekers.
Instead, they state that ‘Sweden needs to continue to attract foreign experts,
researchers and talents in order to strengthen Swedish competitiveness and Sweden’s
status as a research nation’. Therefore, they have been establishing structures that
support labour migration to Sweden and the acquisition of highly educated foreigners
who they believe will contribute to the Swedish society

        <h2>Migration statistics</h2>
        <p>
          In 2015, Sweden received 156 000 asylum seekers, the third highest in the European
Union after Germany and Hungary. However, when numbers of asylum seekers are
calculated per capita Sweden ranked first out of any country in the EU, receiving 1 600
asylum seekers per 100 000 people. The Swedish Migration Agency states that during
this time, the ‘EU’s fundamental principles and regulated asylum migration had been
rendered inoperative. The authority’s ordinary capacity and preparedness were
insu:icient’. 
        </p>
          While the OECD area as a whole saw record-high permanent migration in 2023, Sweden was among the one-third of member states that recorded a decrease in inflows, a trend that accelerated into 2024 with a drop of more than 10% in permanent-type migration. Despite this decrease, the labor market integration of the foreign-born population remains a key focus: the employment rate for immigrants in Sweden stood at approximately 71-72% in 2023, nearly reaching the native-born employment average.

        <h2>Current policies</h2>
        <p>
          Sweden’s 2025 asylum policy is marked by stringent intake controls, stricter
requirements for residency and citizenship, and limited quotas for refugee
resettlement, aligning with the government’s commitment under the Tidö Agreement to
dramatically reduce migration and focus on integration. The asylum process requires
applicants to lodge claims at the border or the Swedish Migration Agency, attend a rapid
investigation (usually within 5-14 days) and, if eligible, await a decision typically within
six months; fast-track processing is available for clear-cut cases, while rejected
applicants must leave Sweden before reapplying and face a five-year ban unless new
circumstances arise (Brentin, 2025; European Council on Refugees and Exiles, 2025).
        </p>
The refugee quota has dropped to historic lows, with only about 540 individuals
resettled in 2023 and roughly 6250 residence permits granted in 2024, alongside
tougher language, civic, and self-su:iciency requirements for permanent status, and
increased repatriation incentives and enforcement aimed at reducing the number of
asylum seekers and accelerating voluntary returns. Financial support is restricted to
those living in assigned accommodation, and an obligatory introduction to Swedish
society is required. Additionally, the controversial ‘track change’ route allowing failed
asylum seekers to shift to work permits has been abolished (Sveriges Riksdag, 2025;
Swedish Migration Agency, 2025; Government O:ices of Sweden, 2025).

        <h2>Application possibilities</h2>
        <p>
          In 2026, Sweden’s application and integration possibilities are defined by a shift toward high-skilled labor and strict "obligation-based" integration. New regulations effective June 1, 2026, have raised the work permit salary threshold to 90% of the median wage (approximately SEK 33,390), while simultaneously easing mobility for highly qualified talent by extending EU Blue Cards to four years and allowing job seekers to switch employers more easily. Integration has transitioned into a formal requirement; residency renewals and the path to citizenship now requiring eight years of residence—are tied to mandatory Swedish language and civics tests and proof of self-sufficiency. Furthermore, as of January 1, 2026, the government has introduced a significant repatriation grant of up to SEK 350,000 per adult for those who choose to voluntarily return to their home countries, underscoring a policy focus on ensuring only those who fully assimilate remain long-term.
