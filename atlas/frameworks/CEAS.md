# Common European Asylum System (CEAS)

The Common European Asylum System (CEAS) is the EU framework that harmonizes asylum procedures, reception conditions, and qualification rules across Member States. It aims to ensure consistent protection standards, prevent secondary movements, and clarify which Member State is responsible for examining an asylum application.

Key elements include:
- The Asylum Procedures framework for fair and efficient processing.
- Reception conditions standards for applicants.
- Qualification rules for refugee and subsidiary protection status.
- The Dublin system for responsibility allocation.
