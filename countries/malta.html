          Malta is a small Mediterranean archipelago consisting of three main islands—Malta, Gozo, and Comino. Positioned at the crossroads of Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East, it has transitioned from a strategic military outpost to one of the fastest-growing economies in the European Union.

      <h2>Europe at a glance</h2>
      <p>Malta is an island country, member of the EU. Known to be a famous holidays destination, Malta is
also a place where migration has been considered as a real issue. This island is in the Mediterranean,
in the south of Italy. Historically, this country has been a net emigration country. Thanks to an
economic development, mainly due to the tourism activities, EU adhesion, several invests and targeted
policies about migration, Malta became in the early 2000’s a net immigration country. Malta
population is about 545000 people in total and 22% of them are not originally come from Malta.</p>

        <h2>Political climate</h2>
        <p>
          The political situation in Malta is strongly tied with the British colonization of the Island. There are two
main political parties, Labour and conservative, based on the Westminster model. These two parties
represent about 90% of the total votes, despite, ADPD (greens) and Imperium Europa (far-right party,
nationalist) are also influencing debates on sustainability and immigration issues. Maltese citizens in
their daily live have to be face some challenges due to the high pressure on public services such as
electricity production, healthcare and education, something that can explain the idea of the
government to stop immigration to fucus on Maltese citizen’s needs, despite the human rights of
migrants are not respected (scandals about no response to SOS from boats…).

        <h2>Migration statistics</h2>
        <p>
          According to data released by the National Statistics Office and reported by the Malta News Agency, Malta’s population reached an estimated 574,250 by the end of 2024, representing a 1.9% increase from the previous year. This growth was driven almost entirely by migration, with net migration adding 10,614 people to the population, while natural growth (births minus deaths) contributed a mere 193 individuals, a staggering 55.3% drop compared to 2023. Non-EU nationals accounted for nearly 77% of this net migration, reflecting the country's heavy reliance on foreign labor in sectors like construction and logistics. Consequently, foreign nationals now make up 29.4% of Malta's total resident population, with certain areas like St. Paul's Bay seeing a foreign population as high as 62.8%. Despite the continued growth, the 2024 net migration figure actually represents a nearly 50% decrease from the peak seen in 2023, signaling a potential shift in the island's decade-long population boom.

        <h2>Current policies</h2>
        <p>
         Malta’s policies on migration have two main sides. On one hand, there is the policy about the
acquisition of the Maltese citizenship for rich people who have the capabilities to invest a lot in the
local economy. This type of policy encourages immigration of a target public, rich investors, that mainly
come from countries whose passport doesn’t give as much travel opportunities as what their home
country passport give. Russian and Chinese citizens are the main target of this policy and are in fact
the main applicants to get the Maltese citizenship to have access to an EU member passport. These
passports allow to travel without nearly any limits through the Schengen space. This policy is a win-
win one. People how apply get a new citizenship that give them more privileges than with their first
citizenship. This policy is also an opportunity for the Maltese government to create foreign invests in
the country and so help the economic development of the country. On the other hand, the Maltese
policy about irregular arrivals is quite strict. This state is the ONLY one in the EU to practice automatic
detention for migrants that arrive by sea for several reasons such as security, the argument that the
island is already socially full... The irregular migration issue is considered as a priority for the Maltese
government, despite this country is no more classified as an under-migration pressure country.

        <h2>Application possibilities</h2>

Malta adopted its new “integration strategy and action plan” 2025-2030. According to the
strategy, it targets “all migrants in Malta, encompassing diverse groups such as third-country nationals,
beneficiaries of international protection, and second, third, and other future generations of migrants,
Maltese and EU nationals. It considers specific characteristics within each group, including gender, age,
sexual orientation, physical ability, workforce participation, and family relationships” (Eu DG Home
Affairs). This new strategy is divided in 6 policies. Each of them have a different goal. The six policies
are:
        </p>
➔ Stronger legal and institutional support
      </p>
➔ Strengthening integration-related government services
      </p>
➔ Expanded integration programmes
      </p>
➔ Improved well-being of migrants through enhanced service provision
      </p>
➔ Inclusive communities and strengthening of local councils’ role
        <p/>
➔ Promoting mutual understanding through awareness-raising initiatives
        </p>
      
All these policies are taking place since only a few months. That’s means the it’s not possible today to
have a lot of backgrounds on the efficacity of these policies so far.
