        <h1>Luxembourg</h1>
      </div>
      <p>
        Luxembourg has a unique and dynamic migration landscape. With a population of about
        660,000, nearly 47% of its inhabitants are foreign-born (the highest share in the OECD).
        Most foreign residents are EU citizens from Portugal, France, Belgium, and Germany, and
        more than 200,000 cross-border workers commute into the country every day. In 2024,
        around 26,000 new long-term immigrants were registered (61% EU nationals and 39%
        third-country nationals). Luxembourg also granted temporary protection to 3,940 displaced
        Ukrainians.

        <h2>Europe at a glance</h2>
        <p>
          Luxembourg is one of the smallest EU Member States but has one of Europe’s most
          international populations. Its migration profile is shaped by high shares of foreign-born
          residents, strong intra-EU mobility, and large daily inflows of cross-border workers.
          Migration policy focuses on regulated legal migration (labour and family) and a structured
          asylum and reception system coordinated by the Office National de l’Accueil (ONA).

        <h2>Political climate</h2>
        <p class="section-political">
          Luxembourg’s politics are stable and typically centrist and pro-European. After the October
          2023 elections, a coalition between the Christian Social People’s Party (CSV) and the
          liberal Democratic Party (DP) formed the government. Luc Frieden (CSV) became Prime
          Minister and Xavier Bettel (DP) became Deputy Prime Minister. Migration responsibilities are
          split across ministries: the Directorate of Immigration sits under the Ministry of the Interior,
          while social cohesion and migration integration are handled by the Ministry of Family
          Affairs. Parties broadly agree that regulated migration should continue, and the coalition
          supported the 2024 EU Migration and Asylum Pact (implementation planned from 2026),
          including EU-wide solidarity mechanisms and faster asylum procedures.

        <h2>Current policies</h2>
        <p class="section-policies">
          Luxembourg guarantees the right to asylum through national law and, since 2023, through its
          Constitution. ONA coordinates reception and accommodation and expanded capacity in
          response to rising demand, including the Ukrainian crisis. Since August 2023, labour market
          tests for asylum seekers were removed to facilitate access to employment and support faster
          socio-economic integration.
          Labour migration is demand-driven and based on the 2017 Immigration Law, amended in
          2023 and 2024. Highly skilled migration uses the EU Blue Card, with an EU salary threshold
          of €58,968; since July 2024 Blue Card holders may move to another EU country after only
          12 months of residence. Luxembourg also uses a national shortage occupation list and a
          fast-track procedure for priority professions. In 2023, efforts against illegal employment and
          trafficking were strengthened through higher penalties and enhanced inspections.

        <h2>Application possibilities</h2>
        <p class="section-application">
          Reception and accommodation are organised through ONA, which expanded services in
          response to increased demand. Temporary protection includes a biometric residence card,
          housing, healthcare, and access to the job market, and has been extended until March 2026.
          Family reunification is a major part of legal immigration: in 2022, 45.2% of residence permits
          were for family reunification. Third-country nationals can apply if they have a residence permit
          valid for at least one year and meet minimum income and housing requirements. The state
          provides language and orientation support for reunited family members. Luxembourg also
          supports student retention by easing transitions from study permits to work visas.
