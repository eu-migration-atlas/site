        <h2>Political climate</h2>
        <p>
          Add notes about the political climate in Latvia.
        </p>
        When it comes to migration in Latvia, there are several key factors and actors that need to be
taken into account.
      </p>
The main ministry that deals with laws and regulations as well as their implementation is the
Ministry of Interior. Other important government-related institutions are the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs, Diplomatic missions abroad, and the Ministry of Welfare (European Commission, 2021).
For deepening the understanding of the context, it is important to note that during the Soviet
era, Latvia experienced significant migration flows, as they were primarily driven by centralised
labour allocation and relatively high living standards. This led to a demographic shift, as
Latvians became only 52% of the population by 1989. Following the USSR’s collapse in the 90s,
a wave of emigration occurred, with many Russian speakers moving, as well as returning
Latvian refugees. Post-independence and EU accession saw a huge influx of Latvians moving
to Western countries. The country’s economic growth and declining population highlighted a
need for skilled foreign labour (Migration Partnership Facility, 2025).
      </p>
With recent economic improvements, Latvia became more attractive to foreign workers from
Ukraine and Belarus. However, despite these trends, immigration rates remain lower than the
OECD average and below those of neighbouring countries. The Russian invasion of Ukraine in
2022 led to a further substantial inflow of Ukrainians. These immigration dynamics have sparked
public debates on security, economic and demographic issues. With the current conditions,
labour migration could be seen as a solution but public opinion is divided: some advocate for
embracing it, others want focus to be put on retaining and attracting back Latvian youth and
expats (Migration Partnership Facility, 2025).
