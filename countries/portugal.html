        Portugal is a republic in southwestern Europe, bordered by Spain. It has been a member of the European Union since 1986.
      </p>
        Historically, Portugal was a dictatorship until 1975, when it transitioned to a parliamentary democracy. A multi-party electoral system was established, and in 1976, the country adopted a constitution. The portuguese government is divided into 3 branches: the Legislative (the Parliament), the Executive (the Government) and the Judicial (the Courts).
