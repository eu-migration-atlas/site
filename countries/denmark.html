          <h1>Denmark</h1>
        </div>
        <p>
          Denmark has shifted from one of Europe’s more migrant-friendly countries to a far more restrictive approach since the 2015 refugee crisis. Temporary protection is now the norm, long-term stays are no longer guaranteed, and policy emphasizes return and repatriation over integration. This overview summarizes the political context after the 2022 election, outlines the paradigm shift in policy, and connects those changes to public opinion signals and migration trend data, with trusted Danish media and academic sources listed below.

      <h2>Europe at a glance</h2>
      <p>Denmark has opted out of EU-wide migration frameworks and does not participate in the Common European Asylum System. This positions the country differently from most EU members, allowing Denmark to design a distinct, often stricter migration regime while still facing regional migration dynamics. The opt-out means Danish rules can diverge from EU standards on asylum, residence, and family reunification, which helps explain the sharper shift toward temporary protection and return-focused policies.</p>

        <h2>Political climate</h2>
        <p>
          The current coalition government (Regeringen Mette Frederiksen II, formed in 2022) consists of Socialdemokratiet (S), Venstre (V), and Moderaterne (M). Socialdemokratiet emphasizes balancing welfare resources with migration limits and has gained seats with a more restrictive stance, which helped make it the largest party. Venstre has moved right on immigration, including calls to revoke dual citizenship, after a significant seat loss in 2022, signaling a tougher line to regain support. Moderaterne views migration as necessary for the workforce and supports safe work laws while remaining open to migrants, reflecting a more pragmatic economic approach to labor needs.

        <h2>Migration statistics</h2>
        <p>
          Public narratives around migration intensified in 2015, with immigration rising sharply as a key issue, then declining again by 2021 as policy tightened. Attitudes toward migrants remained relatively stable in the available data (to 2016), suggesting opinion did not shift as dramatically as issue salience. Migration flow trends show a spike in arrivals in 2015, a decrease around 2021 under stricter rules, and a subsequent uptick—indicating continued migration despite increased insecurity. This combination suggests that policy changes influenced salience and flows more than they shifted underlying public attitudes.

        <h2>Current policies</h2>
        <p>
          Denmark’s “Paradigm Shift” in migration policy prioritizes temporary protection over permanent residence and places strong emphasis on return and repatriation. Family reunification rules have tightened, and integration is less central than before, reflecting a goal of limiting long-term settlement. This marks a clear departure from Denmark’s historically liberal approach to migration and illustrates how the country’s opt-out from EU frameworks enables a distinct national policy path.

        <p>
          Trusted media sources in Denmark include DR News, Politiken, Berlingske, Børsen, and TV 2 Nyhederne, with Ekstra Bladet and BT among the least trusted. For deeper context, recommended reads include: “Translating Policy Into Practice: Local Stakeholders’ Interpretations of Refugee Integration in the Danish Multilevel State” (Vitus &amp; Jarlby, 2025); “The Danish Legal Framework for Migration: Between a Humanitarian Past and a Restrictive Present” (Adamo, 2022); and “Refugee Migration and the Labour Market: Lessons from 40 Years of Post-Arrival Policies in Denmark” (Arendt et al., 2022). These sources connect national policy changes to local implementation and labor market outcomes.
