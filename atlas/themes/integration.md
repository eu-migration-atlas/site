# Integration and inclusion

Integration policy in the EU typically covers access to language training, education, labor markets, housing, and civic participation. Successful integration strategies often combine national programs with local delivery, social partner involvement, and targeted support for vulnerable groups.

Indicators to track include employment rates, school outcomes, and participation in community services.
