        <h2>Political climate</h2>
        <p>
          Slovenia’s immigration trends are still focused on labor migration, meaning that a lot of
people are moving to Slovenia for work. Slovenia continues to rely on these workers.
However, new migrants now face a tougher time settling in because the government has
recently passed laws that make residence permits stricter. Indeed, only 3200 permits were
issued to international students and around 300 to temporary and seasonal labor
migrants.
        </p>
In December 2024, Slovenia adopted a national plan to implement the EU Pact on
Migration and Asylum. Overall, Slovenia is still attracting talent but is also raising the bar
for integration and legal status.

        <h2>Migration statistics</h2>
        <p>
          According to the OECD, in 2024 Slovenia received around 260 00 new immigrants on a
long-term or permanent basis, which is 16% less than in 2023. It corresponds to 15.1% of
the entire population of Slovenia and the majority of immigrants comes from Bosnia and
Herzegovina, Croatia and Serbia.
In 2024, the number of first asylum applicants decreased by 24% to reach around 5500.
The majority of applicants came from Morocco, Algeria and Afghanistan. By January 2025,
Slovenia counted a total of 10 240 non-Eu students citizens who had fled the war against
Ukraine and were under temporary protection.

        <h2>Current policies</h2>
        <p>
          In Slovenia, immigration rules depend heavily on your origin. EU citizens can enter freely
but must register their residence at a local administrative unit after 3 months. On the other
hand, third country nationals generally need to secure a temporary resident permit from
the Slovenia’s diplomatic mission abroad and before their arrival in Slovenia. This is for
work, studies or family reunification, and they are valid for a year. Plus, these temporary
permits require standard proof like a clean criminal record, a valid health insurance and
the proof of stable income. Regardless of the status, anyone with a permit must register
their actual residential address with the local administrative unit withing 8 days of moving
in. In order to apply for a permanent residency, the applicants must have a be registered
for at least 5 years.

        <h2>Application possibilities</h2>
        <p>
          International protection in Slovenia is granted to 2 groups
        </p>
- Refugee status, for non-citizens who have a well founded fear of persecution based
on things like race, religion, nationality or political opinion, and who can’t or will not
seek protection from their home country.
      </p>
- Subsidiary protection, for non-citizens who do not meet the refugee criteria but are
judged to face a risk of serious harm (death or torture) , if they were forced to return
home.
      </p>
Alongside, Slovenia policies on immigration really focus on migrant’s integration. Slovenia
offers an optional “Initial Integration of Immigrants” program that includes Slovenian
language courses, culture and constitution for both third country nationals and
beneficiaries of international protection. However, policies are becoming more and more
restrictive. Starting 1 November 2024, adult third country nationals that want to renew their
temporary residence permits for family reunification must have a A1 level in Slovenian.
