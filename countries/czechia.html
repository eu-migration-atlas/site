        <p>
          Czechia has just held elections in which migration played a major role. This overview explains what the new coalition could mean for migration policy, outlines public opinion trends, and highlights trustworthy Czech media and research sources to follow.

      <h2>Europe at a glance</h2>
      <p>Czechia remains within the EU’s shared legal framework on migration, but it is moving toward stricter national rules. The country has also hosted the highest number of Ukrainian refugees per capita in the EU, which makes its domestic policy choices particularly relevant for EU-wide debates.</p>

        <h2>Political climate</h2>
        <p>
          Czechia has just held elections in which migration was a key issue. A new coalition has been formed by ANO, SPD, and Motorists for themselves. ANO (Andrej Babiš) is a centrist-populist movement that has adopted more restrictive and sceptical tones on migration; it won 80 seats, up eight from the previous election, and emphasizes zero tolerance for illegal migration and stricter migration law. SPD (Tomio Okamura) is a far-right, Eurosceptic party that calls for rejecting the EU Migration Pact and wants a referendum on EU membership; it won 15 seats. Motorists for themselves, founded in 2022, entered parliament for the first time with 13 seats and focuses on pro-car, less restrictive policies for drivers.

        <h2>Migration statistics</h2>
        <p>
          Czech public opinion has become more negative about migration since 2015. In European Social Survey rankings, Czechia is among the most negative on immigration, and 53% of respondents in a recent round said immigration made the country a worse place to live. During the Ukrainian refugee crisis, Czechia hosted the highest per-capita number of Ukrainian refugees in the EU, but the mood has shifted again; one poll found 40% of Czechs say they tolerate Ukrainians but are tired of their presence. Migration data show a large spike in 2022 driven by Ukrainian arrivals, while overall trends are otherwise relatively stable. Settlement patterns show the highest shares of migrants around Prague, with the top district reaching 9.3% migrants per 1,000 residents.

        <h2>Current policies</h2>
        <p>
          Czechia remains within the EU’s shared legal framework, but since 2025 it has adopted a stricter migration approach. New rules allow denial of temporary protection to Ukrainian refugees already registered in another EU member state, and proposals aim to speed up asylum procedures and increase security checks. In 2024, by contrast, policy was more permissive for skilled migrants and workers with jobs, who gained greater flexibility to change employers without additional permissions. The overall direction is a dual approach: welcoming skilled workers while tightening refugee and asylum controls.

        <h2>Application possibilities</h2>
        <p>
          Trusted media in Czechia are primarily the public broadcasters, which rank highest in perceived trustworthiness; Blesk ranks lowest, and proposed funding cuts by ANO could reshape the media landscape. For deeper context, recommended reads include “Analysis of Migration in the Czech Republic and Security Challenges in the Context of the Current Geopolitical Situation” (Šenk &amp; Polcarová, 2024), “Twenty Years of Czech Migration Policy: Liberal, Restrictive or Something Different?” (Kušniráková &amp; Čižinský, 2011), and the EU’s government report on integration and measures for people displaced from Ukraine (Directorate-General for Migration and Home Affairs, 2025).
