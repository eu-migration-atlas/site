        <p>
          Migration has become an increasingly visible and sensitive topic in Bulgaria, mainly due to the country’s geographical position at the external border of the European Union. As both a transit and first-entry country on the Eastern Mediterranean and Western Balkan routes, Bulgaria experiences migration pressures differently than many Western or Northern EU Member States.

      <h2>Europe at a glance</h2>
      <p>While Bulgaria is not a primary destination country for most asylum seekers, it plays a key role in border management, registration procedures, and cooperation with EU institutions. Since joining the European Union in 2007, Bulgaria has been required to align its migration and asylum framework with EU legislation, including the Common European Asylum System (CEAS), while managing limited national capacity and fluctuating political support for migration governance (European Commission, n.d.). Historically, Bulgaria has had relatively low levels of long-term immigration, and familiarity with migrant communities remains limited. As a result, migration debates are often shaped by concerns related to border security, state capacity, and social cohesion rather than integration outcomes.</p>

        <h2>Political climate</h2>
        <p>
          Migration in Bulgaria is closely connected to national security discourse and domestic political stability. Political debates often frame migration as a challenge imposed by Bulgaria’s EU border responsibilities rather than as a demographic or economic opportunity. Periods of increased irregular crossings, particularly along the border with Turkey, tend to trigger stricter rhetoric and emergency measures. Public trust in institutions managing migration has also been affected by concerns about corruption, inadequate reception conditions, and pushbacks at the border (Caritas Bulgaria, 2019).
          Public opinion in Bulgaria remains skeptical toward accepting refugees, especially when compared to Western European states. Several studies confirm that migration is often associated with insecurity and economic burden rather than humanitarian responsibility, partly due to limited exposure to successful integration examples (Center for the Study of Democracy, n.d.). Political actors usually capitalize on these concerns, bringing restrictive approaches such as border protection over relocation or long-term settlement.

        <h2>Migration statistics</h2>
        <p>
          Bulgaria has historically recorded relatively low levels of long-term immigration, and most asylum seekers do not intend to remain in the country long term. This contributes to limited national investment in integration infrastructure such as language training, housing access, and labor market inclusion, reinforcing a system focused on transit management rather than settlement outcomes (Caritas Bulgaria, 2019).

        <h2>Current policies</h2>
        <p>
          Bulgaria’s migration and asylum system is formally aligned with EU legislation, yet its implementation faces persistent challenges. The State Agency for Refugees is responsible for processing asylum claims, while border control and detention fall under the Ministry of Interior. In practice, asylum procedures are often slow, reception centers are overstretched, and access to legal assistance and integration support remains uneven (European Council on Refugees and Exiles, n.d.). Overall, Bulgaria’s migration policy reflects a combination of EU compliance, national capacity constraints, and a political climate that prioritizes control over integration. This makes Bulgaria an essential, yet strained, actor within the EU migration system.

        <h2>Application possibilities</h2>
        <p>
          Many asylum seekers view Bulgaria primarily as a transit state, which reduces incentives to build expansive long-term integration pathways. As a result, access to language training, housing assistance, and labor market inclusion is limited and uneven across reception centers, creating barriers for applicants who do seek longer-term residence.
