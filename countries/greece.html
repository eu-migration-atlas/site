          <h1>Greece</h1>
        </div>
        <p>
          Greece is historically a crossing point for migration flows. This country is positioned at the crossroad of Europe, Asia and Africa. Since the 2015 refugee crisis, it has served as a primary entry point and strategic point for the EU's external borders. 
          The country now functions as both a transit and destination, managing complex flows from the Middle East and South Asia. Greece currently balances strict border enforcement with the daunting task of processing and integrating significant numbers of asylum seekers.

      <h2>Europe at a glance</h2>
      <p>The Eu new pact on migration will be implemented in a couple month, in the early 2026. This new pact aims to improve the Eu policies on migration and support more the EU country where the migration flows are the most important, for example in Greece, thanks to mandatory solidarity mechanism.</p>

        <h2>Political climate</h2>
        <p>
          The Greek parliament is leaded by Kyriakos Mistotakis and his party, New Democracy. He has a large majority and so can adopt strict law about migration without any difficulty. 
          This party is on the Centre-right side of the political spectrum but has to deal with the far-right parties pression to prevent a leak of its electors to these parties. 
          The left parties are weak today in Greece because of strong internal crisis and are no longer strong voices to denounce illegal practices such as the pushback of boats in the Mediterranean Sea. 
          New reforms are coming in Greece such as the Eu pact on migration. The gold visa policy faces some issues such as it created housing crisis in Greece. One other political issue in Greece is the demographic issue. 
          Debates are happening to define how integrate migrants in the Greek society to prevent increased aging population in Greece. Moreover, the public opinion agrees globally with the migration policies leaded by the Greek government. 
          Interviews demonstrate that Greeks are tired of these massive migration flows, especially on Crete island that have to deal with these arrivals and the massive tourism flows. 
          People are for example in favour of the extension of the wall at the Turkish border next to Evros. This wall is often considered as a key to ensure the national security of the country. 
          The asylum ban has been adopted in July 2025 and stopped the asylum seekers procedures for 3 months, justified but the Greek PM but a massive arrival flow of migrants from Libya. 
          ONGs are denouncing a violation of the non-refoulment principle guaranteed by the Geneva convention of 1951 but also the violation of European laws and the violation of the Human-rights Convention such as the effective right to apply for asylum and the violation of the articles 2 and 3 of the convention.

        <h2>Migration statistics</h2>
        <p>
          Migration flows in the Greek islands and Evros showed a mixed pattern between 2020 and 2025. 
          Total annual arrivals, after a peak in 2020 with 40,934, decreased significantly to 7,745 in 2021, then rose to 17,122 in 2022, and further to 40,146 in 2023. 
          In 2024, arrivals were 29,491, and by October 2025, arrivals had decreased by 37% compared to October 2024. 
          Monthly arrivals for 2025 started around 8,166 in October 2024, dropped to a low of 2,234 in June 2025, then surged to a peak of 6,724 in July 2025, before declining to 5,159 by October 2025. 
          Compared to previous years, 2025 saw lower monthly arrivals than 2023 for most of the year, but generally higher than 2024 in the earlier months. Geographically, Crete recorded the highest number of arrivals with 16,777. 
          Other significant entry points included Evros with 5,661 arrivals, Lesvos with 3,673, and Chios with 2,969. Samos, Kalymnos, and Symi also experienced notable arrivals, with 2,822 for Kalymnos/Symi combined, and 2,681 for "Other Islands".

        <h2>Current policies</h2>
        <p>
          The European Union's new Pact on Migration and Asylum is set to be implemented on 12 June 2026, introducing a permanent and mandatory solidarity mechanism to support member states facing the highest migratory pressure. 
          Greece, along with Cyprus, Italy, and Spain, has been officially identified as being under significant migratory pressure and will have access to the new Solidarity Pool when the Pact takes effect. 
          This framework aims to ensure a more equitable distribution of responsibility, providing frontline states with support through the relocation of asylum seekers, operational assistance, and financial aid. 
          This new EU-level support complements Greece's existing national strategies, which include enhanced border controls and the construction of a physical barrier on its land border with Turkey to manage irregular migration. 
          In parallel, Greece is implementing integration programs, such as access to education and healthcare for migrants, to meet human rights obligations and foster long-term social cohesion. 
          Additionally, Greece's 'golden visa' policy, which attracts investment migrants, operates as a separate channel of regular migration, distinct from the asylum and solidarity measures addressed by the new EU Pact.

        <h2>Application possibilities</h2>
        <p>
          Application and integration possibilities for migrants in Greece are shaped by a dual approach of strict border control and structured integration efforts. 
          The application process has faced significant restrictions, notably an asylum ban implemented in July 2025 that halted asylum procedures for three months due to a surge in arrivals from Libya, a move criticized by NGOs for violating international human rights laws. 
          On the integration front, the Greek state, in partnership with the EU, has developed programs to facilitate the inclusion of migrants. 
          These include access to the Greek education system for migrant children and the provision of facilities in reception centers to improve access to healthcare, housing, and primary needs such as laundry and kitchens. 
          These initiatives are primarily aimed at fulfilling human rights obligations, but they also serve a long-term national interest by potentially addressing Greece's aging population; integrating children into the educational system early is seen as a way to encourage them to stay and contribute to the economy in the future. 
          Despite these integration efforts, the overall framework remains challenging, with Greece balancing its role as a primary EU entry point with stringent enforcement policies.
