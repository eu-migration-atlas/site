        </div>
        <p>
          Austria, often described as the "Heart of Europe," is a landlocked alpine nation renowned for its imperial history, world-class music, and stunning mountain scenery. Once the center of the powerful Habsburg Empire, modern Austria is a stable, prosperous democracy and a key member of the European Union.

      <h2>Europe at a glance</h2>
      <p>Migration has played a central role in Austrian political and social debates for more than a
decade. Unlike Bulgaria, Austria functions primarily as a destination and secondary-movement
country, particularly following the 2015 refugee crisis. Its location in Central Europe and position
along key transit routes have made Austria a focal point for asylum, labor migration, and
integration policy discussions. As an EU and Schengen Member State, Austria operates fully
within the Common European Asylum System, while maintaining strong national discretion over
integration measures (European Commission, n.d.).</p>

        <h2>Political climate</h2>
        <p>
          Migration is one of the most polarizing issues in Austrian politics. Over time, public discourse
has shifted toward a more restrictive and security-oriented framing, particularly following the
large inflows of asylum seekers in 2015 and 2016. Conservative and right-wing parties have
played a significant role in shaping this narrative, increasing border control, reduced asylum
intake, and stricter integration requirements (ORF, n.d.).
Public opinion in Austria reflects a mixture of humanitarian concern and integration fatigue.
While there is support for labor migration and skilled workers, asylum-related migration is often
viewed critically, especially when linked to housing shortages, welfare pressure, or cultural
integration challenges (OECD, 2024). As a result, migration policy has become a central electoral
issue and a key factor in coalition negotiations.

        <h2>Migration statistics</h2>
        <p>
          In 2022, Austria received 93 000 new immigrants on a long-term or permanent basis (including changes of status and free mobility), 22% more than in 2021. This figure comprises 63% immigrants benefitting from free mobility, 4% labour migrants, 16% family members (including accompanying family) and 18% humanitarian migrants. Around 4 000 permits were issued to tertiary-level international students and 15 000 to temporary and seasonal labour migrants (excluding intra-EU migration). In addition, 305 000 intra-EU postings were recorded in 2022, a 38% increase compared to 2021. These posted workers are generally on short-term contracts.

Ukraine, Germany and Romania were the top three nationalities of newcomers in 2022. Among the top 15 countries of origin, Ukraine registered the strongest increase (76 000) in flows to Austria compared to the previous year.

In 2023, the number of first asylum applicants decreased by ‑49%, to reach around 56 000. The majority of applicants came from Syria (21 000), Afghanistan (7 700) and Türkiye (7 700). The largest increase since 2022 concerned nationals of Türkiye (2 400) and the largest decrease nationals of India (‑19 000). Of the 37 000 decisions taken in 2023, 62% were positive.

        <h2>Current policies</h2>
        <p>
          Austria’s migration and asylum system is highly institutionalized and comparatively well-
resourced. The Federal Ministry of the Interior oversees asylum procedures, border
management, and returns, while integration policies are increasingly tied to conditionality.
Recent reforms have focused on faster asylum procedures, stricter residence requirements, and
enhanced return mechanisms for rejected applicants (Austrian Federal Ministry of the Interior,
n.d.).
        </p>
At the same time, Austria actively promotes labor migration, particularly in sectors experiencing
workforce shortages. Integration policies increase language acquisition, labor market
participation, and civic orientation. Access to long-term residence and social benefits is often
conditional on meeting integration benchmarks, reflecting Austria’s belief that migration should
be economically and socially sustainable (OECD, 2024).
Overall, Austria’s approach combines restrictive asylum policies with selective openness toward
labour migration. Compared to frontline states, Austria places stronger emphasis on long-term
settlement outcomes and integration performance, making it a key example of how destination
countries manage migration within the EU framework

        <h2>Application possibilities</h2>
        <p>
          Moving to Austria as a migrant involves a points-based immigration system primarily centered on the Red-White-Red (RWR) Card, which serves as a combined work and residence permit. In 2026, the Austrian government has updated its criteria to address a labor shortage of over 200,000 workers, notably increasing salary thresholds and subsistence requirements.

For highly qualified professionals, the RWR Card requires a minimum of 70 out of 100 points based on criteria like age, work experience, and language skills (German or English). As of January 1, 2026, "Key Workers" must meet a higher monthly gross salary threshold of €3,465 (up from €3,225), while the EU Blue Card now requires an annual salary of at least €55,678. A unique feature of the Austrian system is the Job Seeker Visa, which allows very highly qualified individuals to live in Austria for six months to search for employment without a prior job offer.

International students on a Stay Permit – Student can work up to 20 hours per week and are entitled to a 12-month "post-study" extension to seek work; if they find a role matching their degree with a locally customary salary, they can transition to an RWR Card without a labor market test. For those seeking non-work residency, the 2026 monthly net-income requirements have risen to €1,273.99 for individuals and €2,009.85 for couples. Most of these permits are valid for 24 months and lead to the Red-White-Red Card Plus, which grants unlimited labor market access and a path to permanent residency after five years.
