          <h1>Belgium</h1>
        </div>
        <p>
          Belgium is a small yet remarkably influential nation in Western Europe. Often called the "Crossroads of Europe," it is a founding member of the European Union and hosts the headquarters of both the EU and NATO in its capital, Brussels.

      <h2>Europe at a glance</h2>
      <p>Belgium occupies a unique, "dual-identity" status within the European Union. It is simultaneously a founding member, the host nation for the EU’s main institutions, and a policy laboratory for the bloc’s most complex issues.
      </p>
In 2026, Belgium is navigating a period of significant domestic reform while serving as the essential "bridge" for European diplomacy.</p>

        <h2>Political climate</h2>
        <p>
          In the field of migration, the Federal Government is responsible for establishing asylum
procedures and managing refugee policy. It also plays a role in integration through
mechanisms such as the Immigration Policy Impetus Fund (FIPI) and the Centre for Equal
Opportunities and the Fight Against Racism. Regional authorities, in contrast, oversee the
employment of foreign workers, including the granting of work permits and application of
labour standards.
        </p>
Federal elections for the 150-seat Chamber of Representatives were held on 9 June 2024.
The nationalist Flemish party N-VA emerged as the largest formation with 16.71% of the
vote, followed by Vlaams Belang (13.77%) and MR (10.26%) (Belgian Federal Public Service
Interior, 2024). N-VA positions itself firmly on the right of the political spectrum and
promotes the idea that migration is a privilege rather than a right. Its platform emphasizes
criminalising irregular stay, accelerating asylum procedures, and distinguishing clearly
between different types of immigration, accompanied by stronger integration requirements
for applicants.

        <h2>Migration statistics</h2>
        <p>
          In 2024, Belgium received 106 000 new immigrants on a long-term or permanent basis (including changes of status and free mobility), as in 2023. This figure comprises 59% immigrants benefitting from free mobility, 7% labour migrants, 20% family members (including accompanying family) and 15% humanitarian migrants. Around 9 800 permits were issued to tertiary-level international students and 1 100 to temporary and seasonal labour migrants (excluding intra-EU migration). In addition, 231 000 intra-EU postings were recorded in 2023, a 7% increase compared to 2022. These posted workers are generally on short-term contracts.
        </p>
      
Romania, Ukraine and France were the top three nationalities of newcomers in 2023. Among the top 15 countries of origin, Syria registered the strongest increase (1 900) and Ukraine the largest decrease (‑37 000) in flows to Belgium compared to the previous year.

        <h2>Current policies</h2>
        <p>
          Significant legislative changes have taken place since mid-2024. A major law entering into
force in July 2024 restructured return procedures for individuals ordered to leave Belgium. It
introduced a formal obligation to cooperate with transfer and return processes and
expanded the situations in which individuals may be presumed to be absconding. The law
also authorised compulsory medical examinations to assess fitness for travel, raising ethical
concerns among civil society actors. Each person issued a return order is now assigned a
return counsellor responsible for case monitoring, although the mandatory nature of these
meetings and their link to sanctions has attracted criticism. Additional reforms included
broadening the range of authorised escorts for forced return operations and creating non-
detention-based measures such as reporting duties or surrendering documents. Notably,
the law prohibits placing families with children in closed detention centres, restricting their
supervision to open return houses.

        <h2>Application possibilities</h2>
        <p>
          Official statements from the current government indicate that Belgium will continue to
tighten migration policy in the coming years. Planned measures include further restricting
access to social security for newcomers, enhancing conditions for obtaining permanent
residence and citizenship, such as stricter integration and language requirements, and
streamlining asylum procedures to reduce the number of applicants entitled to reception.
The government also intends to prioritise labour and study migration, explicitly favouring
“economic value-added migration” over humanitarian pathways. These developments,
alongside the ongoing reforms to return policy and family reunification, signal a long-term
shift toward stricter control, reduced humanitarian admissions, and strengthened
enforcement mechanisms.
