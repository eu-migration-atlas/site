        <p>
          Lithuania is a Baltic state in Northern Europe that, like its neighbor Latvia, has rapidly modernized since regaining independence in 1990.

        <h2>Political climate</h2>
        <p>
          The political system of Lithuania is a parliamentary republic where the head of state is the
president, Gitanas Nausėda. He has been the president of Lithuania since 2019. Last year in
May, he was re-elected by a majority. He is independent of any party and a stable, secure and
consistent force in Lithuania, which the Lithuanian citizens value as they face fears regarding
the war in Ukraine (Deloy, 2024). The debate around migration has remained relatively stable in
Lithuania compared to other European Union countries. In its political system, Lithuania also
has a prime minister, who is the head of government. The President must approve the Prime
Minister, as well as the ministers appointed by the Prime Minister. This portrays how the two
heads work together (The Lithuanian Nation, 2003).
        </p>
Nevertheless, the country still faces issues, especially regarding Belarusian and Russian
immigrants. In March this year, Lithuania accused Belarusian president Alexander Lukashenko
of organising a migrant crisis in Lithuania, violating international law. The Lithuanian Foreign
Ministry submitted this case to the International Court of Justice. Lithuania has faced a large
influx of illegal migrants from Belarus since 2021, according to the Ministry, which claimed to
have gathered evidence that the Belarusian regime is involved in organising this stream of
migrants (Skėrytė, 2025). Approximately 52,000 Belarusians and 14,000 Russians reside in
Lithuania. (BNS & LRT.it, 2025).
Recently, a discussion has arisen regarding reopening the borders to Belarus, and a decision
on this proposal will be made on Wednesday, 19 November, said Prime Minister Ina Ruginiene.
Ruginiene has claimed that smuggling and disruptions have decreased, and therefore, the
possibility of reopening the borders has arisen (BNS, 18 November 2025).
Simultaneously, the country has been facing citizenship issues regarding ethnic Lithuanians
from Russia and Belarus. Because of the war in Ukraine, processes of application done by
ethnic Lithuanians who moved back to Lithuania after their Lithuanian ancestors migrated to
Russia or Belarus are complicated. Presidential advisor Ridas Jasioulionas stated that this
occurs because the president has abstained from granting Lithuanian citizenship to nationals
from Russia and Belarus, two countries that pose a threat to national security (Valkauskas,
2025).

        <h2>Migration statistics</h2>
        <p>
          According to the OECD International Migration Outlook 2024, Lithuania is experiencing a historic reversal in its migration patterns, transitioning from a country of emigration to a significant destination for international talent. While permanent migration inflows to Lithuania actually decreased by more than 10% in 2023, the country remains a standout performer in the labor market integration of foreign-born residents. Notably, by late 2023, the employment rate for Ukrainian refugees in Lithuania exceeded 50%, one of the highest rates in Central and Eastern Europe and far above the OECD average for recent arrivals. This success is critical as Lithuania faces a "major demographic shock," with a tight labor market where the unemployment rate hovered around 6.9% in 2023. Furthermore, Lithuania has emerged as an EU leader in labor-oriented migration, with approximately 71.5% of non-temporary protection migrants arriving specifically for remunerated activities—one of the highest proportions in the European Union.

        <h2>Current policies</h2>
        <p>
          Lithuania outlines different policies for various types of migration, structured around the motive
for migration, such as restoring Lithuanian citizenship, family reunification, and labour migration.
As a European Union member state and a Schengen area member, EU citizens have the same
rights as in any other member state: residence up to three months can be performed without
any special requirements. Suppose a EU citizen wishes to reside in Lithuania for a longer
period, they may be issued a “Certificate of EU Member State” based on substantial self-
sufficiency, employment, studying, or family reunification, allowing them to reside in Lithuania
for a period of three months to five years.
        </p>
Individuals who wish to restore their Lithuanian citizenship are entitled to receive citizenship
through a simplified procedure and additionally have the right to apply for a Temporary or
Permanent Residence Permit and a Schengen visa. Eligible are persons of Lithuanian origin:
someone of whom at least one parent or grandparent is or was of Lithuanian origin and self-
identifies as a Lithuanian; they must declare this in a written declaration to receive the
documents and rights they are entitled to.

        <h2>Application possibilities</h2>
        <p>
          Family reunification is a primary reason for
immigration to Lithuania. On this basis, one may be eligible for a Temporary or Permanent
Residence Permit. One of the requirements for reunification is that the family member seeking
reunification must prove that they lived with the family member preceding their migration to
Lithuania, thereby ensuring a substantial family connection. To be eligible for employment in
Lithuania as a foreigner, sufficient qualifications and experience in the relevant sector are
required. Additionally, they should be employed before migrating. If all documents are approved,
the individual receives a Work Permit, which allows them to issue a national visa D. This visa
gives the individual the right to work and reside in Lithuania for one year. After it expires, the
migrant is eligible for a Residence Permit (Migration Law Center, n.d.).
        </p>
Lithuania employs a quota system for migrant labour to regulate migration. In October, the
official Migration Department decided to stop accepting new labour applications as the quota for
2025 is almost reached, and the department is still processing 4500 applications. The number of
processed and pending applications for temporary residence permits exceeds the quota;
therefore, the department has decided to halt the acceptance of applications for the remainder
of 2025 (BNS, October 15 2025). Asylum seekers are allowed to apply for procedures in
Lithuania. The procedure follows similar paths to other European Union asylum application
procedures. The procedures are handled by the Migration Department, which may decide to
return the migrant if they have applied for asylum in another EU country or come from a safe
third country. If real dangers are discovered through the information provided by the migrant, the
application is further processed, and the asylum seeker is accommodated in the Foreigners’
Registration Centre (MIGRIS, n.d.).
