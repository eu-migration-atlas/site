          France, officially known as the French Republic, is the largest country in the European Union and one of the most influential nations in world history.

      <h2>Europe at a glance</h2>
      <p>As one of the key countries within the European Union, France has been an attractive
destination for many immigrants from all over the world. Initially, France recruited workers from
foreign countries themselves, dating back to the 1920s and 30s, when workers from Eastern
Europe and Southern Europe like Poland, Portugal and Italy came to fill labour shortages. </p>

        <h2>Political climate</h2>
        <p>
          The political landscape of France has changed a lot through the years. Looking at the 1990s and
2000s, the political landscape of France has seen many remarkable changes, including the rise
of new political terms linked to parties. The common terms used on the political spectrum are
‘left’ and ‘right’, however, in France, this division on the political spectrum became less strict in
the 1980s and 1990s (Chabal et al, 2022). Instead, political terms like neoliberal, anti-neoliberal,
nationalist and globalist were more suitable for political parties, to make their ideologies known.
The crumbling of the terms ‘left’ and ‘right’ on the French political spectrum, can be explained by
some major geopolitical change that has happened around the 1990s. This is namely, the fall of
the Soviet Union (Chabal et al, 2022). Whereas in many European countries, left and right could
find a middle ground in issues related to democracy or free-market capitalism, the political
parties in France could not. At least, not using ‘left’ and ‘right’. Instead, many political parties
repackaged their ideologies using different terms, making their stance clear, which eventually
would lead to similarities between completely opposing political parties (e.g. far-right and
communist parties) (Chabal et al, 2022).

        <h2>Migration statistics</h2>
        <p>
          According to the Insee Première n° 2051 report, immigration to France between 2006 and 2023 was characterized by both a rise in volume and a notable shift in the demographic profile of new arrivals. In 2023, approximately 347,000 immigrants entered the country, a significant increase compared to 234,000 in 2006. This growth was accompanied by a clear "upmarket" shift in education levels: while 41% of new arrivals aged 25 or over held a higher education degree in 2006, this figure climbed to 52% by 2023. Furthermore, the geographical origins of immigrants have diversified; whereas European-born individuals represented 44% of new entries in 2006, they accounted for only 28% in 2023, with Africa becoming the leading continent of origin at 45%.

        <h2>Current policies</h2>
        <p>
          For the policy analysis, a closer look will be taken at the ‘Code on the entry and residence of
foreigners and the right of asylum’ (Légifrance, 2025). This code is applied in all territories of
France, including Guadaloupe, French Guiana, Martinique, Mayotte, Réunion, Saint-Pierre-et-
Miquelon, Saint-Barthélemy and Saint-Martin. Other French territories like e.g. French Polynesia,
have different ordinances (Légifrance, 2025).
        </p>
Firstly, it has to be mentioned that, obviously, France is part of the European Union. Therefore
they are obligated to adopt parts of European Law into their national law. This means that
citizens from countries that are part of the Schengen Area can enter, work and live in France
without difficulties. EU nationals wanting to live in France have to register within 3 months after
entering France at a town hall in the municipality they are staying (Welcome to France, 2025).
After three months, the 90 day short-stay visa will be expired. This is yet again European Law.
However, when foreigners (from outside of the EU and EEA) want to exceed the 90 days stay, and
remain for a longer period of time in France, a long-stay visa must be granted. This is regulated
by the rules of the French national law, called the Code on the Entry and Residence of Foreigners
and the Right of Asylum (Ministère de l’Intérieur, 2024). The long-stay visa is valid for one year
maximum (Article L211-2-1, Code on the Entry and Residence of Foreigners and the Right of
Asylum). In some cases, the long-stay visa is considered equivalent to a residence permit, but
still with the same validity period of a year. Examples of groups in this category of long-stay visas
are; spouses of someone with a French nationality, students, salaried workers, young au pairs or
interns (Ministère de l’Intérieur, 2025). However, if someone with this type of long-stay visa
wishes to exceed the validity of their visa, they are expected to submit an application for a
residence permit. These rules do not apply to EU citizens, EEA, Monaco, Andorra, San Marino
and the Holy See and therefore do not need to apply for a long-stay visa in cases of wanting to
stay for more than three months.

        <h2>Application possibilities</h2>
        <p>
          Regarding asylum applications and their procedure, there are different rules. An asylum
application can be made on French territory, also in the case of an asylum seeker not having a
valid travel document. They can then request to enter France on asylum grounds. If this is
approved, they then have to formally apply for asylum. Lastly, there can be applied for asylum
when a person stays at an administrative detention centre, when it is planned to deport the
person (Asylum Information Database, European Council on Refugees and Exiles, 2025).
The next step, when an approval has been given to the asylum seeker, they have to go to the
SPADA, which is an organization that finds out what the intentions of the asylum seeker are
(Asylum Information Database, European Council on Refugees and Exiles, 2025). 
        </p>
        Asylum
seekers can collect their asylum claim certificate at the GUD. This also serves as their
temporary residence permit. From the moment someone claims this certificate, they are not
allowed to enter another Member State and are expected to follow the asylum procedure in
France. Asylum seekers under a Dublin procedure also have a temporary residence permit, but
this lasts until their transfer to the initial country is completed (Asylum Information Database,
European Council of Refugees and Exiles, 2025).
        </p>
Requests coming from an asylum seeker from a safe country of origin, an asylum seeker which
could be a threat to public order, public safety or national security, an asylum seeker refusing to
give their fingerprints, an asylum seeker with false travel documents, or an asylum seeker who
has been decided on that they have to be removed from the country are examined by the OFPRA,
which is an organization who either approves or rejects an asylum application (Asylum
information Database, European Council of Refugees and Exiles, 2025). The OFPRA has
conversations with asylum seekers and their possible lawyer, to determine whether the asylum
seeker can get approval of their request
