        <h2>Political climate</h2>
        <p class="section-political">
          Italy’s political environment is currently shaped by a right-wing coalition led by Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, whose party ‘Fratelli d’Italia’ has become a dominant force in national politics. This coalition emphasises border control, national security, and a stricter approach to migration, presenting its approach as a “model to follow” for other European countries.

        <h2>Migration statistics</h2>
        <p class="section-migration">
          Italy continues to face significant migratory pressure, particularly via the Central Mediterranean route, which is the primary path for irregular arrivals. 
          In 2024, Italy recorded 66,617 sea arrivals, a notable decrease from 157,651 in 2023 and 105,131 in 2022. During the same year, Italy registered approximately 150,000 asylum applications, one of the highest totals in the European Union. 
          While specific recognition rates by nationality are referenced as a key metric, exact figures are not provided in the document. 
          Return policy remains a central pillar of Italy's migration strategy, with efforts focused on increasing the number of effective returns through cooperation with North African partners like Tunisia and the expansion of readmission agreements. 
          These measures aim to reduce irregular stays and enhance the credibility of the asylum system, although challenges and criticisms regarding human rights safeguards persist.

        <h2>Current policies</h2>
        <p class="section-policies">
          Italy's migration policy is defined by a strict, security-focused approach under Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni's right-wing coalition. The government's national policies prioritize limiting irregular arrivals, accelerating return procedures, and reducing pressure on the reception system. A key element is the expansion of the national 'safe country of origin' list, which enables faster asylum processing and more frequent use of expedited procedures.

Significant recent reforms include the 2023 'Cutro Decree' and its amendments, which introduced stricter rules on the detention of asylum applicants, particularly those in fast-track procedures or deemed a security risk. This aligns with the government's focus on deterrence and efficiency.

For external border control, Italy has implemented new regulations to limit the operational flexibility of NGO search and rescue vessels, requiring them to sail immediately to assigned ports and restricting multiple rescues without prior authorization, justified on grounds of safety and coordination.

In terms of international cooperation, Italy has pursued an ambitious strategy. It maintains active cooperation with North African partners like Tunisia to manage movements across the Central Mediterranean and increase returns. The most notable initiative is the 'Albania Protocol,' signed in late 2023, which allows for the transfer of certain asylum applicants intercepted at sea to facilities in Albania under Italian jurisdiction. This externalization of asylum processing aims to relieve pressure on domestic reception centers and deter irregular crossings, although it has faced significant legal challenges and criticism over compatibility with EU fundamental rights standards.

        <h2>Application possibilities</h2>
        <p class="section-application">
          Italy's reception system is organized around a network of hotspots and reception centers, primarily located in areas of first arrival such as Lampedusa and along the Sicilian coast. This system faces immense pressure, leading to frequent overcrowding, especially during periods of high arrivals. A major challenge is the inconsistency in reception conditions across different regions of the country. Vulnerable groups, including unaccompanied minors and victims of exploitation, require special attention and resources. The government has introduced faster procedures for asylum applicants from countries it deems 'safe' to alleviate some of this pressure.

Integration measures are not detailed in the provided text, though the country's reliance on legal labor migration for critical sectors like healthcare, agriculture, and construction indicates a pathway for economic integration. The primary challenges at the local and regional level stem from the direct impact of migration on communities, including the strain on local infrastructure and services due to the pressure on reception centers, which is a significant factor in the national political debate.
